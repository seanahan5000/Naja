- option to get next token, without skipping whitespace
	- use for : after label

- finish deleting objects on assembler delete

- echo PUT/USE file during assemble to follow progress?

- rationalize case sensitivity (simplify hash table, etc.)

- on missing local, demangle name for error message

### respect TR option and show all hex for easier validation
- add line numbers to .lst file
- implement TR, LST, and EXP options in .lst file

* problem if expression->GetSize() returns 2 during first pass
	but then turns into 1 byte during second pass due to zpage
	symbol being defined later

- error in macro should report file/line where macro included
	not where macro was defined

- test error cases

- parenthesis in expressions
- '|', '&', and '~' operators
- operator precedence in expressions (/,* before +,-)

- "DASM" syntax support
	- reorg
	- ".byte" or ".word" instead of "DS 1" or "DS 2"

? support forward references in EQU and '=' ?

? switches to enabled/disable support for particular assemblers


### OPEN PROBLEMS ###

ALIENS\ALIEN.PICS.12
ALIENS\ALIEN.PICS.345

Start of data doesn't match because output of XXX macro
(from ALIENS\EQUATES\ALIEN.MACROS.S) differs.
I think I'm generating the right bytes but the reference files
have the byte pairs swapped.

FIGHT\FIGHT.LOADER

Output doesn't match reference file.  The equates for S_DATA12,
S_DATA17,S_DATA15,S_DATA13,S_DATA11, and S_DATA9 are used to build
the tables DATA_SECTL and DATA_SECTH.  Some of the values in that
table don't match the equates.  The reference file has values that
don't make any sense -- unless it was not the latest assemble of
the sources or the file was somehow corrupted (which seems unlikely).

TRACC\ASM.CAMP.S

Lines 244-246 generate (FF FF FF FF) but reference file contains 
(A4 00 01 0C).  This is very likely caused by a change that was
made without reassembling.
