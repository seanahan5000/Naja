# Player's Sequence of Events

## Administration Level

The group arrives at the station with very little information about it, or the council.  They are almost immediately greeted by a creature who introduces himself as an Alliance **Secret Agent** - doing undercover work.  Among a few other tidbits of helpful hints, he tells the group about how to access the Council Log Entries.  The option to view Council Log Entries always comes up when at a Station Computer Network (Scan) Terminal.  The Scan Terminals are located throughout the Station.  This is not the Core Computer, though he has been known to tap into the Scan System on occasion.

In the Logs, the Council states more plainly where they are at (*"Lambert reporting - I am in what appears to be some sort of view port room."*), then we just filter the logs to them in the exact order that they were logged, regardless of the area that the player is in.  We let them get as many files as we want them to have, and shut them down by having the core "spot" them.  Once a particular Scan Terminal is shut down it is permanent.  We could even have it short out right in front of the player.  All previous Log entries are accessible with WristComp in "camp" mode.

If it were to be set up this way, we could grant a different amount of log entries in different places.  If it was a "hard to obtain" terminal, then we give them more entries to read before shutting them off.

The Group is free to wander around the Station, but a few areas are not accessible to them yet.  Ruuik's barriers are blocking a good portion of this level.  Also, the damaged area has been barricaded up and the group cannot kill them to gain access yet.  The Vegans have control of the elevators.

The Council Logs are mostly "character build-up" at this point.  The group should happen across the area of the Station which houses the Council's administration facilities.  This includes individual work rooms for the seven Council members (plus a spare - in case the Alliance acquired another Member), along with the Council's Conference room.

**1**) This area has been taken over by an alien named **Ruuik**.  At the entrance to this place there is a sign on the door which reads "This marks the border of King Ruuik's Domain".  Inside the "domain" there is a high chance that the group will encounter the royal troops.  They are Pseudo Non-player characters that demand the "password" or they will attack.  If the group gains the Council's Conference room, they will meet the King.  He declares himself supreme ruler of the planet", and wants to trade with the group.  (Five Medium Rifles) for the code to the Barriers.  On Ruuik's desk is the Ornese Element Key - he is using it as a paperweight, and apparently doesn't know what it is.

He graciously offers the troops' password so the group may return unmolested.  He asks if there is anything else that the group wishes to know.  We let the player type in things here and lead him toward the rock in this manner: "I do not understand the word - computer - do you refer to this?", followed by an animated motion towards the rock.  If the player inquires about the paperweight, Ruuik says that he doesn't know what it is, and lets the group inspect it.  The rock disappears from his desk - WristComp says that the rock is a blah blah blah rock - indigenous to Touhtaa, the Orn planet.  The group has the option of trying to pocket the rock, throwing it at Ruuik, giving it back, attacking, etc.  Every option except *giving it back* results in the stunning of the group.  They wake up outside of Ruuik's Domain.

**2**) The group can get the **Barrier code** if they return with the requested weapons.  This allows them to gain access to the Reception Room, where they find the Station's dedication plaque.  This should be something ironic so we can have a group member comment on it.

The group makes it to the view port.  The backdoor access to the Council's Conference room is locked with very high clearance level door.  This door leads to the back of Ruuik, and is to be used later for his assassination.

**3**) Somewhere behind Ruuik's barrier is a **Council log by Banah** the Xenologist, where he discusses some alien activity that he has observed.  The group can assimilate this information into the Xenological Data Module (XenoDat), which comes up when the group gets into encounters.  This information should flash by when the assimilation process is occurring.  This may be accompanied by sound.  He talks briefly about Ruuik's soldiers, which he observes installing the barriers.  He talks about the language of the Vegans (warriors, and officers), this is the trigger to killing them.

**4**) The group must be able to **defeat the Vegans** to gain access to the elevator.  Now that they have the language of their race decoded and part of the XenoDat, they can be destroyed.

**5**) The **Elevators** also has the retina-scan type security clearance - different level for each shell.  Maintenance is way too high for the group to get clearance.  But the Scientific and Living Quarters levels will probably be reachable by now.

**5A1**) If the group goes to **Living Quarters**,

Access to level three immediately available but the area on level three is severely restricted by the space warp.

**5A2**) The group can get to the **Nul-Grav Gymnasium**.  In the Gym, when the group tries to move in a direction, they continue to move until they hit an obstacle, like a wall.

**5A3**) They must make it to the equipment room and find the body of Banah, the Denebian Council Member.  On his person is the **Denebian Element Key** - the other Council Members took the wrong one.

**5B1**) The rest of the shell is blocked by the **EnviroLock** machine.  This can be destroyed from behind only.  When the group jumps down off of the bridge they can access this robot and destroy it.

**6**) If the group goes to **Scientific Level**,

**6.1**) The **Hameler Hot Head** is on the outskirts of the damaged area and he is in the mood to talk.  He knows of the Markabians - his race has been studying them for some time now.  He and a few others have been sent to the Station to observe the monstrosities that they are doing.  Tells a few of them.  Shouldn't fight this guy, but if the group does - they split up with sword strikes, and are unbeatable.  Make the characters have to walk past the guy (in battle) in order to get to the damaged area.  When the group gets past the Hot Head and it reverts back to the Hall view - then he should come up and wish the group luck and give him helpful hint about the Repair Units in the area beyond. What he says is - "never attack a Repair Unit before it attacks you."

**6.2**) Get through first half of **level 2 damaged area**.  The area should be dark with electrical stuff hanging through the walls, etc.  The group goes into battle against the Repair Units and just walk by if they do not get fired upon.  If they make it beyond the Unit then they come out of fight grid and are in the next square.

**6.3**) In the damaged area of level 2 (in what used to be Plasmatron Testing) the group will find a council log where someone in the Council explains **how to build an Immobilizer**.  He was inspired by examining the plasma damage and how it was reacting.  Player could be prompted by the conversation of the characters about this - "Golly gee, Beave, I bet the Arsenal would love to get their hands on this information."  When the player brings the information back we could reward them with Credits, as if they were being paid for their idea.

**6.4**) When the group gets free of the damaged area, they can go to the Arsenal and **give the Immobilizer information** via WristComp.  The next time the group is in the Arsenal, there are Immobilizers on the list, and they can be purchased.

**6.5**) **Buy Immobilizers**

**6.2.1**) The group should make it to the **Cryogenics** area.  When the group was on the other side of the Cryogenic Center, they found that the door was inaccessible.  The WristComp says that it has been pressurized from the other side and that is why it won't open.  Now that they are inside they can exit this way easily.  Once they go out they can get back in without going through the Damaged area.

**6.2.1a**) In the Center, they find a few Cryogenic capsules and can tap in get information about the aliens that they see in the cubes.  In the back of the Center is a **Council Log describing the Stilicxian Key**.  When the group is reading through this log, the Core spots them and talks - and then releases the frozen aliens.

**6.2.1b**) They also get the description of the **Council's altered robot**.  This was your basic security robot that the Council has taken and reprogrammed to act as a surveillance scout.  It never returns to the Council by the time they die, but it is hanging around on Administration Level, and if the group were to offer the correct password it would spit out all the information that it has learned about the alien life on the Station. In this Log the group gets a description of the robot, as well as the password.

**6.2.2**) And lastly, the log tells how to get into the Hydroponics area.

**6.2.3**) In the **Hydroponics** the air should have humidity mists flying by at times.  The group can look into the Hydroponic Chambers and wander around.  They are attacked by Slime Creatures, and TRACC Fungus, etc.

**6.2.4**) The **bridge** over the Denebian Botanical Gardens is in here and if the group tries to go across they meet up with the Green Cyborg thing who does battle.  The battle grid should be one unit wide for this.  The Cyborg does not die, but gets pushed off of the bridge.

**6.2.4a**) When defeated, the group goes into the room beyond the bridge and find the **Stilicxian Element Key**.  This key should be described well enough in the Logs so the player knows enough to open the Chamber and get the "food/key".  This Key is placed here so the player thinks that this is the reason for this special - when in reality, it is the access to the Living Quarters level.

**6.2.5**) If the player tries to turn on the bridge and **jump off** the picture should wobble and the WristComp comes up and someone says something like = "Boy, that was a close one, better not do that again."  If the player does do it again - they are given the option to jump down.

*SMC: Word this less negatively so they'll let it happen - "That was close.  If we try that again, we'll fall (for sure)"*

**6.2.6**) Down in the Denebian Garden they find the broken Scepter of the Cyborg and also the **Robot Restrainer**.  There should be pics of this in the corner to make sure the person goes and gets it.  From now on, the group sees the Cyborg "following" them around.  Can never get close enough to the being to get into battle.

**6.2.6a**) **Kill EnvironLock** on the way back to the elevators.  This will be kind of a cheat battle, because the thing must be able to be destroyed by the group - no matter how low on energy, short of weapons, or badly shot up they are.

**6.2.7**) Now that the rest of the Living Quarters has been accessed, the group will come across the **Space Warp** special.  This barrier, when faced, puts the group into battle mode, and is virtually unbeatable.  It must be by passed by chucking an Immobilizer into the heart of the thing while in battle.  Nothing else has any effect.  If an Immobilizer is thrown in then the group members start to get sucked into the thing.  One by one the Members disappear into the void of this thing, and when the last is pulled in, the view goes back to perspective and the players are through the barrier and in the next square.

Now the group has traveled back in time to when the Council is making its attempt to reach the Core.  Beyond the Space Warp, the group finds Unn the Orn.  In the conversation that follows a lot of things happen.

First, the group has information about what will happen to the Council, because the group has uncovered more Council Logs than have been written (at this point in Unn's time).  Unn does not tell the rest of the Council about this meeting (mostly, so we don't have to have different Council logs for each of them), but of course Banah is reading the logs and finds this out, right before he gets killed.

Secondly, Unn becomes disillusioned by the fact that they (obviously) haven't been successful in the quest.  His Logs, from now on, will reflect this.  He becomes more determined, and kind of quiet, etc.

Thirdly, when this particular special is over, and the group has made it back to their own time, the logs that they have uncovered that Unn hadn't yet written are now different.  In these altered logs should be some information of value.  For one, he describes his Element Key to the group (he is almost talking right to the group in his logs.)

The group could give Unn the right Denebian Key, if they have it.  Then we can just give it to the group again, later.  This should only be an option if the group has it at the time of contact.

The group starts to become light-headed, and must return to their own time.

**6a**) The **Transmutation Chamber** is also easily accessible to the player right when they get to Scientific.  They can experiment with the machine, and make different things.  They have to type in the Atomic number of the elements in order to make them.  This only can be done if the player has been to the Library.  Otherwise, it says that the group can try random numbers, and the WristComp picks for the group - surprisingly enough, the proper "guess" is never made.  If they have been to the Library, then it asks the player to type in the number.  The door that the things appear in is not accessible so the characters cannot go in and get what they have made, because "something has gone wrong" and they must "flush" the unstable material out the hatch.  This way we prevent the player from getting all sorts of junk as equipment.  Or things are unstable and they change back automatically, or we let them go a get all of this stuff and just call it "junk" in their equipment list.

**6b**) The player can also find the **Astronomy Research** area and assimilate the different star system information for the XenoDat Module.  In here, the Council has spent long hours searching out the Markabian territory so that they might find out something new.

**7**) In the **Photon Testing** special, the group can go into the "viewing room" portion and see the shots going by, or they can go to the door and hear the shots.  They must run in and go to the first door as fast as they can, in between laser blasts.  If they do it in a reasonable time they make it, but if they try to go to the second door on the first try they get blasted.  They must take the trip in stages.

**8**) The third of these doors allows them access to the back of the Photon machine and they can shut it down.  Also there is a **weapon** that one of the Council has left there.

**9**) There is still an area of the first level that cannot be reached at this time.  It is the area of the **barricades**.  They are too strong for most weapons, and the shots just ricochet off, and the aliens behind do not die.  The new weapon that the group has acquired is very effective against the barricades.

**9.1**) Run across the **Information Seller** that is "wanted" by the Alliance for illegal sale of information and restricted drugs.  This is what he tries to sell to the group.

*SMC: Tell you they are harmless*

Right now he is pushing the Strength and Reflex drugs.  Each time the group uses the drugs and comes back for more, the price goes up.

**9.2**) Buy the drugs to give to the Beta Centaurian in the Medlab, leads to dead end.

**10**) They meet the Council's Altered Robot in the area beyond the Barricaders.

**11**) If they have the proper code (from Log in Cryogenic) they get, among other alien information, the "Brain Frequency" of the Cerebromorph who is not letting them past the library entrance.

*SMC: Will this be too late? Get info sooner?*

**11.1**) This Brain Frequency lets the Brain Jammer put this guy out of action.

**11.2**) Gain access to the Scan Terminals for the **Library**.  Most of them have been destroyed by the Plasma/acid that is coming through the ceiling.  The one terminal that is functioning has a lot of useless (but interesting) information.  Buried in there is the Elements Chart which the player can use to make the "destroyed Element Key".  It is not "earmarked" as anything other than one more piece of useless information.

**11.3**) The Element Chart is in there, and is not earmarked as THE information that the group has uncovered.

**11.4**) The group can take the atomic number of the proper element and go and **make that element** in the Transmutation Chamber on Scientific, except they do not really know that they have to do this yet, however it is possible, and will not upset the flow of events.

**NOTE**: The group now has completed the two things that will trigger the Core spotting them and **stranding them on level 1**, by closing off the elevators.  The first is the "brain frequency" information from the Council's Robot.  And the Second is the Robot Restrainer.  If they have both of these things and then are up on Level 1, and trying to go down - they should be "spotted" by the Core and their clearance denied.

**12**) The group has to **kill the Council Robot**.  This must be arrived at by the player.  The robot will show up often enough, and talking to him will get the same "no more available data" message (this is to show its uselessness).  Also, the robot should have an identifiable ID key built into the right side of its face that looks exactly like the ID key that the group has been putting up in front of their faces all along.  Could prompt them if we felt it was necessary.

*SMC: This would be obscure/non-obvious to player*

**13**) This allows them to find the part of the **robot's face** that will allow them to fool the Core into thinking that they are not Alliance Members, but rather just another security robot.  Having this Robot Head will allow the group to go to either the Maintenance Level, or Medlab.

**13.1**) If the group goes to **Medlab** they must first battle Medbots.

While in the pharmacy area of the Medlab, the **Beta Centaurian** shows up and demands drugs for information.  The information is bogus and then he sniffs up the drugs and attacks the group.  This makes him pretty hard.  The drugs must be gotten from the Information Seller on Administration Level.

There is an **Implant** department of the Medlab that the group can put in "experimental" implants - ones that they can get no other way.  There is no Log in Medlab, because it would be so out of sequence with the area.  Put the Log outside of the complex.  There is a Quarantine area where the group could get an illness.

**14**) If the group goes to **Maintenance Level**:

**15**) They will run across the **Cell Block**.

**15.1**) Free the good alien from the Cell by solving the "**logic code**" on the door.

**15.2**) He gives the group the "**fix-it**" **program** for the Core.

**16**) They see one of the Xxtys Element key in one of the Cells and when they go into get it, they **get locked in**.  The Green Cyborg is back, and pissed off.  He torments the group through the window.  He will let the group go if they hand over the Xxtys key.

**17**) When the group **gives up the Key**, the Cyborg lets them out, and disappears.

**17.1**) The group **sees him around** the station (level 4) and cannot quite seem to get close enough to get in battle with him.

**18**) Eventually they "trap" him beyond the hole in the **ventilation system**.  The group must crawl through and then they can do battle with him.

**19**) He is a **Cyborg and must be killed** with the aid of the Robot Restrainer.

**20**) They get the **Xxtys Key** back after battle.

**21**) They also get the log that describes the destruction of the Human key.  The group now knows they must **make a replacement** at the Transmutation Chamber.

**14.1**) Now that the group is in the Maintenance Level they can "hot-wire" the elevator into taking them to Core Level (even the Robot head doesn't allow them down there).  Basically just wires that they connect until the right combination is found.

**14.2**) Battle General Klamlox in the one-eighty tunnel.  Get information to kill him as you battle, come back a couple of times and he is more injured each time.  He recognizes the group.

*SMC: think out how this would work*

**14.3**) Reach the Element Key Door.  Put the Five elements in, and abracadabra.

### NOTES

In the **sleeping** area, the group finds bathrooms with Puddle Creatures and Gasser aliens.  They find malfunctioning doors from the Plasma/acid drips.  Find Tangible Gas guy back there in a "random room". He uses psionic communication to tell the Members that his race is in danger from the Markabians.  "...You must defeat the dark power from Markab.  The weapon that was used on the [Eltanin] and [Adharan] is also a great danger to our life forms, unlike the weapons that your races possess.  The dark power is entering the space that we claim for ourselves, but has not yet discovered that we exist.  You must stop them.  We are peaceful beings..." something like that.

At the **Back Door**, the group hears the rumble of Markabian ships going in or out of the Station.

At the **Botanical Gardens**, the group can experience different atmospheres - whistling wind of Zin, Gravity (energy draining, slow steps) of Touhtaa, etc.

## CORE
- One elevator has core access - maybe needs some sort of hot-wiring to function
- Hallway that goes to E-door twists 180 degrees
- Three battle guard at door
- Orb door
- Tunnels are different than rest of station
- Core link scans up Access Tube 1 and gives display of what the core computer looks like.
- The core computer patches into the WristComp and interrupts the scan with threats and accusations.
- The group has the information to change the core back - gotten from Alosf Daaahr's information that the council put into their logs.
- The group changes the programming of the core computer without shutting it off.
- Group goes up access tube 1 to make the first changes - area directly around the access tubes is gravity free.  Signs on doors.  Group just floats up the tube.  Give option of looking up or down when in tube.
- Finish changes on access tube 2 without any real problems.  Core is hassling the group.
- On to the next Access Tube.
- Core is attacking the group with quick close doors.
- Group is attacked by robot-remotes while making the changes.  The fighter group member has to take them on single-handedly.  He/she saves the day.
- Door closes behind the group when leave Tube 2.  Core scrambles the door code - can't get through.
- Changes on Tube 3 goes without a hassle - this worries group - core is silent.
- Core is beginning to develop split personality traits.
- Door to Tube 6 is locked and scrambled by core - forcing group out side door.
- Life support-less area.  WristComp gives "Air remaining" countdown, and maybe a map.  Could be dark.
- Get to Tube 4 and it doesn't have life support either.  Physician gives injections that allow the group to live on the low air.  Saves the day.
- On to Tube 5
- Tube 5 is energy cable from floor to ceiling and there are barriers near it - blocking group from access.  No way around, according to WristComp.
- Juicer "bleeds off" or overloads the energy field while the group goes through.  Saves the day.
- Don't have to change anything on 5 - on to Tube 6.
- Core is almost on side - can't really decide whether or not to attack group.
- At Tube 6, information about changes is inaccurate, Computer/robotics expert must save the day.  The ball goes into the Player's lap, the robotics expert consults the group on matters (actually the player)
- He/she begins to run into problems, but the core is almost cured and helps out on the final stretch.
- Kind of a formal "thank you" from the core.  This should be involved enough to make the player think that it is the **real** awards ceremony.
- Among other things, the core begins to tell the story of the demise/capture of the council. Player gets time to go through the core's account of what happened.
- Near the end of the story the core cuts in with the Intruder Alert warning.
- Tunnels have red flashing lights?
- Sound?
- "I alerted the Markabian forces, and they have just docked on Maintenance Level.  You must leave." (show ship docking)
- Core tells group they can't leave that way - must try to make it to the Markabian Escape Pod. (show escape pod) there is no view port shot of it.
- Estimation of interception (countdown) begins
- Directions given (either map or "left, right, forward") to escape pod
- Core estimates that group will not make it in time
- Leave someone behind otherwise group won't make it / escape pod only holds four (or whatever - one less than group) *SMC: compress them?*
- Get into suits
- Pressurize room
- Get in pod
- Blast out
- Get congratulations from people
- Ceremony
