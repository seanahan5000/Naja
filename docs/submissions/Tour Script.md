10/5/1988

        Hello, my name is RELAYER.  I am a level 25 Android and I will be serving as your guide for today's tour of the Star Cruiser Mothership and of the TRACC station.
	    Let me first begin by telling you a little bit about the Mothership.  It is the largest and most well equipped of the Star Cruiser class ships of the Tactical Force fleet.  The Mothership and it's crew have seen action in several battles along the border of Markabian space, but are now positioned near the TRACC station to serve as a base until the station becomes operative again.  It has every facility that TRACC station explorers would need,  all of which you will be seeing during this tour.
	    So if you are ready, let's begin the tour by going to the Enrollment and Testing center.  Some of you may notice the robot guard on the left.  It is perfectly harmless as long as you don't do anything threatening.

    <pause>

	    The computer you see in front of you serves several functions, one of which is processing the applications of new enrollees into the tactical force.
	    To demonstrate this process, I'll pretend as if I'm enrolling into the Tactical Force for the first time.  The process is very simple actually.  The enrollment computer first asks my name...then which race I belong to...and my gender.  After matching this information with its files, it evaluates my qualifications and presents me with my statistics in graph form.
	    It then gives a certain amount of leeway in the form of adaptation points to adjust the areas where I will apply my training.  I can adjust my intelligence, strength, lower  reflex,  upper reflex, and I can also apply some of my adaptation points towards credits, which are the monetary units here.  I would also need to tell the computer what my body composition is.  This is just how much of me has been replaced by synthetic parts.  The advantage to synthetic parts is that they allow me to  withstand more damage, but the drawback is that I use more energy because of them.
	    In addition to powering synthetic parts, energy is also used to power weapons as well as being converted into a form usable by organic parts, as a substitute for food.
	    I'm just giving you a brief description of how all of this works.  The manual that all new cadets get, explains all of this in more detail, as well describing each of the professions and the minimum required statistics for those professions.

	    Okay, now you will notice on the left that the enrollment computer has told me that I meet the minimum requirements for an Android.  So I will chose that profession and give the oath that all newly enrolled cadets give.  It then tells me that I will need to go to the group assembly office to form an exploration group.
	    Before we do that, let me just mention that as the enrollment computer is indicating with testing option, this is also the place where TF members come back to after exploring in the TRACC station, to see if the qualify to go up in rank.
	    Now, let's proceed to the next stop on our tour.

    <Walk to the group assembly office>

	    As some of you may have gathered from the sign on the door, this is the group assembly office, and sitting behind the desk is Mr. Trepr Lelvk.  He is the administrator of this office and one of his responsibilities is to assist explorers in forming groups.  So, why don't we take a look at his roster of available explorers. You will notice that it just gives a brief description of each of them.  We can now select people to add to our group or remove from our group.
	    I'll select myself and these other six explorers, which I should mention have been generous enough to donate their time to help me demonstrate for you just exactly what an exploration group goes through in any given day.
	    Okay, now you'll see that Mr. Lelvk then provides us with a summary of each of the members of the group.  It lists their professions, names, and it also lists their electrical and physical shielding rating.  Those numbers indicate how resistant that member is to electrical and physical types of damage, respectively.  The summary also tells you how much damage each member has and how much they can take, as well as how much energy they have and how much they can hold.
	    Let's step out of Mr. Lelvks office and continue with the tour.

	    We are now standing at the entrance of the shuttle loading area.  Say for some reason, I no longer felt capable of serving the Tactical Force to the best of my ability, I would come here to catch a shuttle back to my home planet.  I would give my name to the guard you see standing here  who would in turn send it to the enrollment computer so its records were up to date.  Of course, any member that wants to leave The Force, is encouraged to reconsider his or her decision.

	    Now before a group goes out on an exploration mission, there are some other details that they must attend to first.  If you will follow me, I'll lead you through the intra-mothership transport and on to the arsenal complex.

	    The first area we will see in the arsenal complex is the energy distribution center.  It is merely a place for TF members to buy energy.  They can also sell energy here if they are really in need of credits.
	    We'll have Mechanismo demonstrate how the energy transfer process works.  And we'll use Blaster's credits to pay for the energy.
	    All you have to do is tell the operator how much energy you want, and zap, you have a little more spring in your step and a few less credits in you account.  It's as easy as that.

	    Now if you will follow me once again, we'll walk over to the Arsenal.

    One quick word of caution here before we enter.  New cadets should be careful when dealing with the arsenal's proprietor, Mr. preet-glavis-wuurn.  He's a fast talking salesman.  And he may sell something you don't really want or need.  Of course, don't tell him that I said any of this.

        The arsenal is the place for group members to buy, sell, identify, and repair equipment.  For demonstration purposes, let's have Mechanismo buy a piece of equipment, using his own credits.  The arsenal always carries a supply of the basic equipment that beginning explorers will need. Let's take a brief look at some of the blasting weapons.  Judging by the large supply of even the more rare weapons, one would have to guess that some very experienced explorers have been selling equipment here.  Equipment that can only be found in the inner depths of the TRACC station.  Obviously, the arsenal can only list equipment that they've seen and had a chance to examine, so not all equipment that can be found in the station shows up in these lists right away.
	    Lets also take a look at the armor purchasing process.  It's very simple to order a piece of armor.  Just tell Mr. Wuurn how much electrical and physical shielding you want your armor to have and before you know it, he's taken your credits and given you your armor.  Needless to say, he doesn't make any guarantees nor does he take returns.  I will skip showing you the selling, identifying, and repair services because they are pretty straight forward and self-explanatory.
	    Let's leave the arsenal and walk over to the next area.

	    Once again, the sign on the door makes it quite clear where we are....the robot ordering and replacement center.  If a cadet selects the cybernate profession, he or she is allowed to purchase one robot.  A robot is essentially a fighting machine that is an extension of its cybernate.  So cybernates are responsible for the maintenance and programming of their robots.  In fact, the two are inseparable.
	    I'll just give you a taste of what it is like for a cybernate to purchase a robot, without going into too much detail.  Cybernate training would be needed to fully understand everything involved.
	    When purchasing a new robot, the cybernate selects the features he or she wants for that robot.  Obviously, the better the features, the more expensive the robot is.
	    As you can see here, the robot that our cybernate has ordered costs more than we can afford, so we'll just cancel that order.  In fact, starting cybernates can usually only afford the most basic of robots.  And then as they earn more credits, they can come back here and trade in old parts for newer and better parts.  And like the arsenal, the credits you get for trade-ins are never as many as you expect.

	    Now that you have seen all of the arsenal complex, we will be heading to the next stop on the tour.

	    We are now at the infirmary.  This is where TF members that are ill or damaged from their explorations in the TRACC station come to receive medical attention.  The staff here is excellent and able to treat just about anything that a group member of any race could contract.  Just tell them who needs treatment and who is paying for it.  Then, after diagnosing the patient they indicate what type of treatment he or she needs, and then provide it.  Let's step out of the infirmary and head back to the transport

	    You have now seen all but one of the areas of the Mothership that Tactical Force explorers have access to.  Of course that's a small fraction of a very large ship.  So lets go to the last of those areas.

	    All explorers going to the TRACC station do so via the tesserport.  Tesseracting is basically a way of going from point A to point B without actually traveling the three dimensional distance between those points.
	    Now before we go to the station I must remind you that it is very important that you stay close to the group.  The explorers we have with us will easily be able to protect us from anything we come across, but if someone gets separated from the group with no weapons or armor, they are as good as dead.
	    If everyone is ready, we'll proceed to the TRACC station.

****************************************************************

	    We are now on the outer level of the TRACC station.  The primary goals of explorers in the station are searching for information as to the fate of the Council of Five as well as trying to determine why the station is no longer functioning.  These are formidable tasks to say the least but all explorers know the importance of the TRACC station to the survival of The Alliance.

	    But first, my group of assistants will demonstrate for you the more every day types of things that explorers do.
	    The first thing that a newly assembled exploration group must do is decide where each member walks in relationship to the others.  They want to make sure that the stronger members are in the front rows with the other members finding varying degrees of safety behind them.

	    They can also trade equipment as well as credits among each other.

	    If the group members are particularly trusting of each other, one member can be put in charge of the group's credits by pooling all of the credits to him or her.

	    Group members can also evaluate their individual statistics

    <show individual stats>

    They can move equipment around...putting it on, taking it off.
    drop equipment that they no longer need
    as well as examining their equipment.

	    Group members can also transfer energy among themselves.

	    A physician can diagnose the health of any of the group members, including himself.  As well as treating the members if he's carrying the proper equipment.  <pause>  As you can see here, Blaster is in perfect fighting condition and needs no treatment.

	    I should also point out that most of these same types of things go on in the Mothership, as well.

	    During their explorations, explorers may find abandoned equipment laying around, although they don't always know what it is or if it is still functional.  Of course, the arsenal is a handy but expensive place to find out this information.

	    And they will definitely come across hostile aliens.

    The Mothership's TRACC intelligence division has estimated that there are between 100 and 150 different alien species and robot models currently infesting the station.  And most of these aliens were previously undocumented.

        We, however, will be giving you a combat demonstration with somewhat less unusual aliens.

*****************************************************

	In battle, each group member has several actions that he can take against the attackers.  The upper and lower reflexes of the expLorers determine how quickly they can complete various actions and therefore how many of those actions they can complete in any given period of time.

    <Blaster>
        Blaster will be demonstrating some of the various swing techniques.

    <Mechanismo>
        Mechanismo will use his disintegrator to demonstrate the useful ricochet technique to shoot at aliens in the back rows.

    <Electrode>
        While swinging and shooting are being demonstrated, Electrode will throw an immobilizer  at one of the aliens.

    <Rom>
        And Rom will be showing off his reflexes by moving around a little bit.

    <Cyborg>
        The groups cybernate, Cyborg, who is injured, will wait for Blade who will heal cyborgs wounds with a cell regenerator.

    <go into narration>

    <running, empty front row>

        You will notice that there is a gap between the exploration group and the closest aliens.  The group can now decide whether they want to advance towards the aliens or retreat from them.  Retreating would be the best choice if the aliens were getting the best of the group, but in our situation, let's advance towards them.  Of course, the group never knows what the aliens will do.

    <second round>
	    While the group plans it's next round of attacks, I should mention that as the upper and lower reflexes of the group's members increases, they will be able to make more and more attacks in a shorter period of time.  As an example, a top notch explorer could get in 6 swings in the amount of time it takes a new explorer to swing once.

*****************************************************

	    Once the group has successfully destroyed the attackers, they are compensated with credits which are awarded by the enrollment and testing computer.  This officially takes place once the computer has had an opportunity to review the records of the battle recorded by the group's android.  Members also gain in experience with successful combat.
	Also, an android in the group can scan the remains of the dead aliens for any equipment that may be of use to the group.  Of course, like any other equipment found in the station, you may not know what it is, what it does, or if it's still functioning.

    <go into another battle>

	    And, although this is not a very pleasant subject to talk about, the cold reality is that not all explorers survive the challenges of the TRACC station.  If an entire exploration group perishes, the TRACC intelligence division of the Mothership will eventually  learn of the groups fate.  They will notify Mr. Levlk at the group assembly office and he updates the missing explorers' files with the enrollment and testing computer.

	    This concludes our tour.  I hope that we have been able to give you a feel for what life as a Tactical Force explorer is like and that the written material we have provided answers any other questions you may have.  If not, Mr. Levlk at the group assembly office would be happy to answer any additional questions.

    Thank You.
