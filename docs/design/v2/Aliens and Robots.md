# Aliens/Robots

## Administration Level

**Ruuik's Solders** - (Administration Level) (Monopticoid) - Top animation could be the eye blinking.  King Ruuik is sitting in the Tech's chair in the Council of Seven conference room.  He is the only one sitting at the table.  Right as the player walks into the room a shot of this shows up.  Ruuik is flanked by dozens of his troops all pointing their guns at the group.  Ruuik does his business (different than it was - still a trade equipment for information, but different information) with the group.   Has Ornese Element Key - uses it as a paper weight.

**Info Seller** - (alternative names: ) found in Station now.  Basically the same picture.  Have him sell the drugs, as well as information.  Still put the wanted poster in the manual.  He is not working for the Alliance, just trying to cash in on the situation.  *SMC: if you kill him, he is gone*

**Barricade** - (Administration Level) This isn't how it was before.  The barricade is not just for barricaders anymore.  Instead it's a barricade in the normal sense/it blocks the path.   It should be irregularly shaped, and in a specific shape that "fits" a group of monsters.  The three or four aliens that are "fitted" for this barricade are then put into the hall and the barricade is placed over them so they are peeking through, or over, or under parts.  Along with this idea - aliens could be masked and thrown over each other to form groups.  Barricades show up on top views and have a damage animation and they disintegrate in stages.

**Tentacles** - (alternate name needed) This alien comes through the floor panels as does the Rigelian Sniper.  Their top views slither out until the end of battle.  Could also have damage animation - tentacle by tentacle getting destroyed.  Pic is not all that different - maybe panel is pushed off to the side instead of the flip-top style.  No treasure.  Never moves.  Only one depth of hall pic because they surprise often.  Pull equipment away.

**Worker Insect** - attack animation.  Look upgrade for all insects.  Must make a deliberate attempt to make this whole thing different than "Alien" - especially in the looks department.

**Asymmetric Alien** - (alternative name) hand opens and closes on attack.  Just for the fun of it, we should make one of the stupid looking aliens very smart, and one of the smart looking aliens very stupid.  This would be a good candidate for that.  Picture would remain quite the same, except shaded and better color.

**Burrowing Taan** - Alien Information Screen (AIS) could show the eating habits of this alien to show why they have such long appendages. Top view animation would show movement of arms, probably a lot of frames.  Picture will change substantially.  Uses arms for locomotion (like octopus).  Give it another arm.

**Scavenger** - (technical name in AIS) alien runs immediately, high experience, good equipment payoff.  Picture has it dragging the bag like the miser instead of wheelbarrow.  In fact whole alien could look like the miser.  Zig-zag running animation.

**Inversion Alien** - I would like this guy to work as planned, if possible.  Gets hit and stores the blast (sometimes - time has to pass before it can be prepared for another absorption - one/two punch used to kill - they virtually explode from overload).  The top animation would be the absorption filter.  Store the energy level and shoot it back.  Rifle shot would not be on Hall pic.  Conversion idea is implied by name and anything in the AIS.  Change this alien considerably, or make a robot if original function is thought of.  Could be area specific to the Matter/Energy converter on Maintenance Level.

*SMC: Use fact that shots ricochet off aliens (here and/or in other aliens)*

*SMC: Too many weapon types to store blast*

**Vegan Warrior** - They key to killing these aliens is unlocking their language (getting it into AIS) so that the group can figure out what the commands are.  Tentacles move when they walk for animation.  Change artificial arm, and make arms without an elbow bend.  Make tentacles on legs a little longer.  Moderate treasure.

**Vegan Officer** - Hang in back of group more than Vegan Warriors.  More treasure, take more damage than same.

**Space Man** - Simple to kill - explosive decompression.  Picture remains pretty similar.  Give him a couple/three weapons or pieces of equipment to carry in hands.  Top view animation could be explosive death.  AIS shows what alien looks like under space suit.  Lives on a high pressure planet.

**Sonician** - sonic grenades practically kill this guy.  Knows lots.  Talk to him if you can get past his xenophobia and paranoia.  Kind of a neutral character - doesn't believe in what the Markabians think or the Alliance.  Doesn't want to get involved.  Inadvertently informs group.

**Wandering Thought** - I see this as a humor thing.  These guys are not here as a result of the Markabians and are not evil.  They are out exploring and are interested in the races and dig into their minds to see what makes them tick.  Make the group do weird things.  Mark 100 technological rating.  Group should try to talk to them but it doesn't have to have any effect.

**Slaviot 2000** - These robots were meant to do superficial maintenance of the station.  Very closely related to damage control robots, but much more stupid.  These two models have been around for a long time.  All the builders did was reprogram them for use in the station.  Slaviot brand cleaning robot.  Model 2000 (standard).  Basically just a cleaning droid with very little intelligence.  Uses a variable control Stasis Repeller to remove dirt from the surfaces of the TRACC Station.  Picture should show it on the ceiling.  Suction cup type thing.  Thing that looks like a vacuum.  Has a compartment for keeping "useful" items.  This allows for pretty good treasure.  Can harm the characters with the modified Repeller (stronger - basically removes the skin from your body). Can short out Stasis Shields, and take equipment from group with retrieval claws.  Durable, slow, and stupid, but they look modified, and let's remember that they are Core controlled.  Pinching attempts at equipment for animation, or sweeping motion of vacuum thing.

## Scientific Level

**Sceptarian** - (new name) This guy meets the group on the bridge.  Talks with them and fights them.  Falls off of the bridge during the battle and gets killed (this would be the animation).

**Slime Creature** - Make pic less humanoid, more swampy, slippy, slimy.  Make bent over like he can't fit in tunnels very well.  Inflicts contagious illness.  Hits for a lot of physical damage.  Not very mobile.  Attack animation.  Top view bigger.

**TRACC Fungus** - very similar to Barricade and Okkar Plant, but inflicts disease when exposed for long enough.  Damage animation.  Could reproduce.  Easier to blow away than Okkar Plants.  Maybe add Webbed Parasite-type patches to pic.  Pict should be more transparent looking.

**Fighter Insect** - attack animation.  Fighter Insects are the strong version.  Almost identical to worker insect, but much stronger attack form.  Attack with weapons?

**Loop Head** - (alternative name) Hack-slack alien.  Pic alterations should include size increase, removal of club (give rifle like Unknown Plant had).

**Fingers** - (technical name in AIS) Nothing having to do with immobilization or holding characters.  Just a Hack-slash guy **Or** the top view could show one hand that is shaped to grab a character and hold him.  This would be the animation (the grab).  This could be spectacular effect.  Alien position could be better - make fingers more 3D.  Make him look at group.  Final picture could be filled with hand (like Latcher), and make full pic at depth 1.  Pseudo-NPC but hard to get much out of because he's pretty stupid.

**Rigelian Sniper** - Trap door look is good, except make panel smaller.  Sniper then could pop around in the fight grid.  Only one depth needed for hall view, because it always surprises the group.  Open and Close animation. **OR** make it come up and stay up, but just difficult to hit (shots fly over head).

**Atom Arranger** - Elaborate top animation will carry most of this alien.  Just a Hack-Slash alien.  Each hall view depth should be different shape.  I like clothes and feet.  No weapons.  Find in the matter alteration room where player makes the element key.

**Particle Man** - Less humanoid but basically the same pic.  Found in Matter/Energy conversion area.  Animation is of "tail" flickering.  Disintegrators have little effect.

**Beta Centaurian** - image generators.  I view these guys as very close to the Alliance members in technology.  Smart fighters.

**Phasoid** - An alien with naturally occurring Phasing, or a high order of alien that has Phase technology, and has implemented it as an implant, or equipment (always destroyed).  Hall view picture changes completely.  Top animation should be phasing in and out of the alien around the fight grid.  If it is an alien with naturally occurring phasing then illustrate in the AIS, or have council talk about it.

**Hameler Hot Head** - If turned into NPC, the Hall view animation could be good.  Make eyes and mouth of picture less defined.  Top view animation would be the burning.  Splitting with swords?  Fireball attack.

**Plasmanoid** - Found in damaged areas.  Not an intelligent alien, but a rather different alien.  Sun dwellers that have been formed by the mishap in the Plasma Control Testing area that the Markabians mistakenly stumbled across.  These are tough aliens, and can form (multiply) in the middle of battle.  Must be dissipated some how - split up - maybe with sonic grenades?  Chain reaction when this is achieved and they explode each other.  Picture is good but too humanoid.  Make more ambiguous, or maybe they are little black hole creatures that were formed from the explosion, or maybe they are just creatures that absorb the stuff and have all gathered there to "feed".  Attack is like a blaster or energy blast from fingertips.  Attack animation possibilities.  Immobilizers could react positively with the energy and last indefinitely - (way of "killing" them)

**Mediot** - (MedBot) These robots were meant to serve the inhabitants of the Station.  A medical robot produced by Slaviot.  Has Neuro-paralyzer beam, Bio-disrupter (modified Cell regenerator), Laser scalpel, Ultrasonic attack, atom compressor, and various other non-attach equipment like - clamps, tubes, etc.  Could give him a bunch of weird drugs that he infuses into the characters, and makes them do weird things (like Wandering Thought). Find lots of equipment after defeating this guy - capsules, medical equipment (how about a lot of Credits - damn rich doctors).  Good sensory equipment.  Fragile, but dangerous.  Could give humorous conversation before he attacks - "Hello, what seems to be the problem. Turn to the right and cough."

**Repair Unit** - Specially designed TRACC Station repair units meant to service the superstructure of the station.  As big as it was but more maneuverable looking.  Keep in mind the tunnel and door size.  Has all sorts of equipment on it.  Laser swords, welder type things, rams people, has big gripper arms.  Attacks come from all parts of the top view.  Manufacturers logo in view.  Adharan built.  Mostly found in the damaged area of Scientific Level.

## Living Quarters

**Puddle Creature** - (Liquid Creature) This idea is sound.  Liquid alien that is relatively harmless, until heated then it becomes stronger.  Attack animation that gets faster when it gets stronger.  Sonic Grenades splatter it.  Easy to run from.  Electrical is transferred to characters.  This alien should be difficult enough to kill that the player doesn't think that heating it is the way to kill it.

*SMC: Too D&D?*

**Gasser** - Not explosive death like the Space Man, but releases noxious fumes and this harms the group - disease - damage or something like that.  AIS shows what alien looks like under space suit.  Lives on big gas type planet (like Jupiter).

**Okkar Plant** - mostly meant for use with Okkar Marsupial - but see Barricade description.  Picture of plant remains pretty much the same.  Plant top views fit together in a way that hides their individuality, like original.  Have damage animation.  Could be area specific to Hydroponics or Botanical Gardens.  Easier to destroy than Barricades.

**Okkar Marsupial** - Attack animation: reaches into pouch and pulls out weapon and throws it.  Attacks with grenades or such.  This alien should fit well with Okkar Plant.  Picture overall.  Speedy little tree swinger.  Never shows up without Okkar Plants.

**Psilotis Pedetum** - Look is very similar.  Hack Slash.  Slow. Top animation is a damage type thing, keeps attacking until it is no more idea.

**Zetoc** - almost an intelligent plant.  Hack-slash.  Top animation when damaged (spastic kind of thing).  Infection, or disease infliction.  This is a wimp.

**Queen Insect** - egg laying animation.  Very little defense, but also very little offense.

**Insect Egg** - hatching animation, and becomes insect.  Can be destroyed easily when still in egg form.

**Squinter** - This is going to be one of the aliens that really confuses the Council.  It is a low technological rating but it has artificial parts.  The Council discusses this; talks about the reported slave planets of the Markabians.  Need animation idea.  Picture is good and bad; good because it's kind of an interesting alien, but bad because it is a bad pose.  I like the feet.

**Speedo** - some sort of movement animation (swooshes from incredible speed, or arm movements).  Pretty fragile guy, but hard to hit.  Very fast.  Hard to run from.  Give him a weapon, and find as equipment afterward.  Could find powders on him.

**Sub-Zero** - I would like to find a spot for this guy.  Maybe near the Temperature control thing on Maintenance Level, or in the Stilicxian Botanical Garden.  Make him more industrious than before - give weapons.  Make cold just a part of being and not an attack of any kind.  Drop movement stats of group because they get cold.  Damage animation (melting).  How about turning this melted guy into the Puddle Creature.  Get attack by it right afterwards, or even changes into right in battle.  Klikx has seen these aliens before - she talks about them.  Regeneration of these guys - they just spring up (form out of the air)

**Meern Mutation** - All of the Meern Mutations prays to the back door.  In the land that they come from their god lived underground and rumbled (some sort of volcanic worship).  Look is pretty good.  Play up the mutation part in the Council logs and in the AIS.  Give weapon.  Pseudo-NPC but hard to get much out of because he's so stupid.  Council talks about the mutation experiments and how terrible they are - one more reason to condemn the bad, bad Markabians.

**Sharpshooter** - Cheat shot.  Shoot equipment out of characters hands.  Shoot things out of air?  Change the bottom of alien a little to make less humanoid.  Improve clothes look - maybe make more space suit looking.  This is also one of the aliens that the Council gets kind of pissed about.  Sharpshooters are the result of big time genetic manipulation to the point where the Council is disturbed.  Mostly the difference between this and what the characters are going to be doing to themselves is; A) the characters are doing it out of their own choice and the sharpshooters have not.  B) what the Alliance is doing is temporary alterations, and what they do will not be passed on to the next generation.  The sharpshooters appear (by the Council's scanning of the remains of a specimen) to have been born this way.  C) The Alliance is not doing cross breed alterations.  It is just improvement of existing and implantation of mechanical assistance, not grafting or implantation of genetic structures taken from other beings.  Animation - maybe the scanning of the eyes before a shot.

**Ebkal'ee** - If this is going to be a NPC, I view him as being evil, sarcastic, and not truthful.  Slams on Alliance a lot.  Could have him slam on Alliance, races and skills of characters, then give them the option of attacking.  If they just continue to take the abuse, and slander, then they learn a lot.

**Cerebromorph** - This is no longer a mind altering alien.  Any good ideas left over from him are transferred to the Encephaloid.  Make him a NPC and give him real subtle mind altering capabilities, talking the group into doing things that they shouldn't, or some sort of trade thing.  Gets extraordinary prices for his information.

**Robien Brain** - Link between aliens and robots.  Will look like a brain with things coming out of it, encased in a transparent casing.  Robot legs and arms.  Travels with robots and controls them (not apparent) with its weird Psibotic ability.  Kill it and the robots that it is traveling with temporarily shut down - or permanently - or they just wander off.  Hangs out in the back row, and doesn't fight directly unless forced to.  Could make it act like a catalyst with the robots. They fight better and take more damage when it is "helping" them.  Gives them an element of improbability that they would otherwise not have.

**Security Robot** - These robots were meant to serve the inhabitants of the Station.  Basically just a Police Robot.  Put in the Station in case of "close quarters" trouble - people getting on each other's nerves and such  Now he's one of the more deadly robots in the Station.  Attack is not all that bad - just a moderately harmful stunner weapon.  Excellent sensory equipment, very good defense attributes.  Conversation before battle "Stop! Do not resist. I do not wish to harm you."  Actions are not exactly running parallel to what it is saying (Core is overriding the original programming).  Assassin Robot picture, with modifications - and with a "twin" that the Council has altered.  Icon for "security" is on chest "clearly marked".

**Librarian** - These robots where meant to serve the inhabitants of the Station.

**Self Defense Practice Robot** -

**Food Preparer** -

**Robot Repair Robot** - Robots used to service themselves, acts like physician in battle - doesn't show up alone.  Cruises around the fight grid and (top animation) "fixes" them.  Makes robots have higher hit totals.  Just acts as a general multiplying factor - doesn't really fix the robots - if it doesn't reach a certain robot; it won't matter, because the number was changed at the beginning of the battle.  This would allow us to have difference strengths of the same robots, but in a plausible manner.

**Botanical Upkeep** - These robots were meant to do superficial maintenance of the station.  Very closely related to damage control robots, but much more stupid.  These two models have been around for a long time.  All the builders did was reprogram them for use in the station.  Senbob Robotics, a Denebian company, makes the Botanical Upkeep robots.  Senbob means "Growth".  Should be very utilitarian looking.  Rugged, amphibious, cutting tools, digging tools, acidic "super-fertilizer", lights for night work, stunner for animal control, water supply, solar powered.  Attacks primarily with the laser-trimming devices (swords).  How about "blinking lights" type things on the top animation.  Should have manufacturing logo on the thing.  Should be dirty, and beat up, and have no shielding.  Found in Botanical gardens.

## Maintenance Level

**EnviroLock** - Specially designed TRACC Station repair units meant to service the superstructure of the station.  (special) - See above

**Portable Airlock** - (EnviroLock) This is pretty much the same as it was.  Now it is a barrier on Maintenance Level blocking the group from the Markabian backdoor.  Now instead of getting to this by falling down the two story room, the group goes through the ventilation system (following the Council's path).  Group can attack it from the front, but this accomplishes nothing.  Machine is next to a door and when the group comes around the back way they still have to kill it, to gain access to a series of rooms.  These rooms have access to the back of cell block? has possibilities.  Maybe there are two aliens in the cell block, one the group gets out with the code and the other can't be broken and the group breaks into the cell from the rear.  The being that they break out doesn't necessarily have to be a good guy (Green Cyborg).  After he breaks out then attacks the group.  Physically it is more of an energy barrier than it was before.

**Alien in Cell Block** - handled outside of the fight grid?  This alien should have a couple of views, with some animation (like talking).  He has valuable piece of information, trades for freedom.  Group must unlock the cell door.  A version of the original - kind of a two dimensional look to it.

**Green Cyborg** - In the Cell Block, can talk to him from the front, but can't seem to get him out.  He appears to be a good guy in this dialog.  Get to him from behind (see EnviroLock) and bust him out.  He attacks group and can only be killed by damaging his programming.  Has the Element key.  Top view animation should be more elaborate than most ordinary aliens/robots (same with other Key Guards).  Damage of flesh to reveal the robot underneath (Terminator).  Loses limbs and keeps on fighting.  Picture is solid, but alternate views and positions needed for the conversation portion.

**Glioplast** - I wish things could stick to this guy.  Look is great.  Top animation could be arm movement (attack).

**Latcher** - I think that if this were made more like an insect that it would be scarier.  Attack animation (jump).  Latchers act like leaches - grab a hold of, and drain the life out of the character.  Character isn't immobile or anything but the thing gets dragged along if he moves.  Hall views of Latchers are small and insignificant until at encounter depth, then the full screen shot is thrown up to simulate the jump.  Make picture have multi-eyes and more disgusting mouth, webbing, and more lethal claws.  If a small electrical shock is given to the character they will detach.  *SMC: how?*

**Najan Mind Slave** - (alternative name) Brain Jammers are ineffective and Robot Restrainer doesn't work because it is the Core that is controlling them.  Picture should have same legs, but different head.  Attack in groups and are very organized.  One of the poor Markabian slave species.  Find some way of liberating them?  Animation is pincers pinching, or give him a shield animation, or the thing in his head pulses "when he gets his commands".  Physical and Electrical attack.

**Informer** - Zig-zag running animation.  They act like Scavengers - run on sight, but little or no equipment (would be scanners if any) and if they get away then encounter odds increase.  Start in front row.  Make the number and relative position of this alien reflected in the Hall view.

**Invisible alien** - (technical name in AIS)  Only one hall view needed for this alien.  Pick him up at the last minute as if some scanner detected it.  Alien becomes visible for a short time on the fight grid before fading (when it moves) **OR** could make it more intelligent and give it some sort of cloaking device that hides it, and after the battle the group could get it.  How would this affect the character's top view in battle?  Maybe just decreases their encounter rate.  Maybe gives them the option of sneaking past aliens a bunch of the time, and opting out of encounters.

*SMC: Use regular type name? (just alien w/cloak)*

*SMC: Like idea of only getting cloaking device from this alien*

**Anticipator** - (technical name in AIS) let name and picture play with the player's mind.  Make alien very hard to hit.  Make animation a defense thing, with him popping back and forth in the square as a shot cruises past?  Change the look of alien, and remove weapon in hall view.  Decent treasure.  Irregular timing of rapid fire shots is what works best (use parry increments).

**Blinker** - This guy randomly moves characters around in the fight grid.  In the picture: make the arms and hands much smaller and almost useless, expand on the garment, and make the sword suspended in mid air near the head.  They use their telekinetic powers for battle in this way also.  This psionic power is not compatible with the brains of the Alliance races, but they use it for almost all physical object movement.  Animation of the sword swinging, or an energy flicker showing that a teleportation is about to happen.  Adjust any position dependent commands of the Characters.

*SMC: More like repulser.  No teleportation if possible*

**Encephaloid** - Expand on clothes - have it parted a little so some of the body can be seen.  Make less humanoid in the face.  Tell characters to: move, do nothing, not run, drop equipment, run (if Encephaloid is near death), shoot at self, swing at self.  Character's heads should pulsate to indicate a brain-wave takeover.  Before battle conversation starts off well but the Encephaloid soon realizes that he is dealing with inferior minds, and attacks.  Group gets some unintentional information out of these little chats.

**Energy Robot** - Robots used to service themselves.  Originally meant to give energy to other robots, like a refueling tanker for a fighter jet, but now, predictably, it turns its attention to killing Alliance people.  Energy attack.  Explodes when killed.  See Robot Repair Robot for alternate idea that could also work on this.

**Intruder Robot** - The most lethal of the TRACC robots because they were more closely made for the function that they now perform - intruder extermination.  Originally these were not expected to be needed.  This is a head-sized, Dragonfly brand auto-remote.  Controlled by the Core; it is very dangerous.  It flies around in computer-like motions and shoots its built-in blasters at the intruders.  Very difficult to hit.  Has its own Shield (visible on Hall view picture).  Hall picture could be similar to Ricochet/Intruder Missiles.  Top animation is a rotation-like movement.  I picture this like the hunter-seeker in Dune, the Bit on TRON, and the remote that Luke practices with on Star Wars.  This could have all, or none of the properties that we wanted for the Ricochet Missile.

**Triped Robot** - The most lethal of the TRACC robots because they were more closely made for the function that they now perform - intruder extermination.  Originally these were not expected to be needed.  (Series 7RF (rapid fire))  Quantum Industries manufactures the Triped series robots.  They are the deadliest of defense-style robots.  Tech designed computers operate the rapid fire Blaster system.  The most powerful of the random encounter robots found in the Station.  Picture will remain pretty much the same, but better.  Top view will be bigger, animation could be the movement of the firing heads.

**Fighting Machine** - (Unknown name) Markabian built.  Looks kind of like the 4-sword robot (Mechanico 450).  Works independent of Core.  Bad ass.

## Not Established

**Space Warp** - top animation would be the grid lines traveling towards the back of the thing.  Throw in an immobilizer to force it into sucking the group through.  Barrier special.  Absorbs everything other than immobilizer.  Coming up on it from the back - the hall depth shortens until the group gets past the thing.

**Secret Agent** - This guy IS working for the Alliance, and doing a good job.  Probably the most complicated NPC next to the Core Computer.

**Council's Robot** - (alternative name) This is the robot that the Council has altered and sent out to do surveillance.  Basically the Assassin Robot with markings, and password type thing.  Group hooks in and gets some information.  Could get in contact with the group more than once.

**Organism Cloud** - Top view should blend together so it looks like it is one "cloud".  See if we can get the cloud to act in an interesting way - surround characters.  Picture is very much the same.  Burning is very effective.  They inflict illness or disease.  Top view animation might be difficult to get anything that looks like gas.

*SMC: Too D&D (swarms)*

**Spike** - (cut this guy) More dramatic pose for this guy -- less humanoid.  Attack animation (stabbing motion).  Inflicts bleeding statistic.  (technical name in the AIS)

*SMC: boring*

**Tangible Gas** - Give this guy a weapon to hold in the picture.  Gas gets more solid looking near the weapon, like he is making himself more tangle to grasp it.  If this were an NPC, he would communicate with brain waves.  This could be interesting.  Could attack with Psi blasts of some kind.  Change space suit to look a little more alien.  Could be some cool animation of hall view if he is going to be NPC.

**Dome Heads** - element key guard

**Big Robot** - element key guard

## Notes

- Aliens of different types that are in the same encounter should attack each other sometimes, if possible.
- Aliens and robots that can be found in the same company should be placed on the screen so that they can be masked and slapped over each other - no more than two groups. Not at multi depth either.
- Having aliens be area specific should not be too restrictive (like: must be rectangle shaped area)
- Make technological rating chart and put in manual, or a permanent part of the Alien Information Screen along one side (little bar graph type thing).
- Some aliens and robots should show up behind opening doors.
- Triggers in the Alien Information Screen (AIS) that allow the group to kill the aliens or robots, or talk to them or deal with them in other ways.  For instance: The language of a previously unbeaten alien shows up in the AIS and the group can now understand their commands and effectively battle them.  Probably the most common form of this would be in the category of "effective attacks against".
- Give image generators to aliens (show up as solid aliens, not like image generated characters).
- All important aliens must be defeated in battle before player is allowed to advance.
- Option to talk to aliens and trade, etc. is given in AIS so they can go back to original picture.

*SMC: Evenly distribute attack types that kill aliens.  Distribute the status key inflict too.*
