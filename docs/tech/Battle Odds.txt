BASE ROUTINES

SUSEPTABILITY takes raw damage passed to it, and based on the alien's susceptibility to a particular type of attack it either:
    Decreases damage to zero    (S=0)
    Decreases damage by 50%     (S=1)
    Leaves damage the same      (S=2)
    Increases damage by 50%     (S=3)
The routine is called AFTER damage has been reduced by the alien's electrical and/or physical shielding so that the susceptibility only affects the damage that gets past the armor and to the alien.


DISTANCER calculates a crude distance factor from 0 (closest) to 10 (farthest) by taking:
DISTANCE = (( |Xalien - Xcharacter| + |Yalien - Ycharacter| - 1) MIN 10)


AIM RATING returns a rating from 0 (best) to 8 (worst) by the following:
          I = (IntelligenceCurrent - IntelligenceInitial)
          U = (UpReflexcurrent - UpReflexinitial)
    AIM = (DISTANCE - ((I + U) / 20 - 1)) MAX 0
Remember to note the difference between using the square that the character is aiming at and the square that the shot hits.





CHARACTER ATTACK TYPES

CHARACTER SWINGING

• Odds of hitting alien:
    BASE = 40.00 [% odds of hitting when all else is equal]
    DIR = 0.90 [Left]
        = 1.00 [Center]
        = 0.90 [Right]
        = 1.00 [All three]
    SW = 1.20 [Thrust]
       = 1.00 [Vertical]
       = 0.80 [Horizontal]
    SIZE = 0.80 [Tiny (0)]
         = 0.90 [Small (1)]
         = 1.00 [Normal (2)]
         = 1.10 [Big (3)]
    DO = 1.10 [Parrying]
       = 0.90 [Swinging at different square]
       = 1.00 [Anything else]
    DIFF = UpReflexcharacter - UpReflexalien
    RAW = (((BASE + DIFF) MAX 1) MIN 99)
    ODDS = RAW * DIR * SW * SIZE * DO

NOTES: This will have to be special cased when the alien has a special status, such as Immobile or Stunned.  Character can thrust and vertical swing at any of the three squares.  They can only horizontal swing if the squares to the left and right of them are empty and are not walls.  If they horizontal swing with a wall on either side, the narration will say so and not complete the swing.

• Damage inflicted by swing:
    BASE = weapon energy use
    ST = 0.80 + (Strength / 100)
    SW = 0.75 [Thrust]
       = 1.00 [Vertical]
       = 1.25 [Horizontal]
    H = 1.00 [One hand]
      = 1.25 [Two hands]
   DAMAGE = BASE * ST * SW * H

NOTES:  Damage will then have to passed through alien's physical shielding and then physical attack susceptibility.  Hands and Rifles will have to have some nominal number assigned to BASE.

CHARACTER SHOOTING (BLASTERS)
• Accuracy of shot is randomly within plus or minus AIM * 2 pixels
• Odds of hitting alien:
    • Always use O12 for characters in the shot grid

    • Pick aliens to put in grid based on:
        BASE = (10 - AIM) * 10
        SIZE = 0.80 [Tiny (0)]
             = 0.90 [Small (1)]
             = 1.00 [Normal (2)]
             = 1.10 [Big (3)]
        ODDS = BASE * SIZE
******* THE ABOVE ODDS HAVE BEEN REWORKED *******
******* ODDS OF HITTING ALIEN ARE DROPPED BY 25% IF IT IS NOT THE PRIMARY TARGET.  IN OTHER WORDS, SLOP SHOTS ARE LESS LIKELY TO HIT OTHER ALIENS.

NOTES: The status of the monster does not effect the odds of it being put in the shot grid.

• Damage inflicted by shot:
    Damage inflicted is straight forward.  Energy use of weapon less electrical shielding of alien with susceptibility adjustment to electrical attack.



GYRO BOOMERANG
    • Always goes to the square you aim at
    • Works just as a swing would but with different narration
    • Physical damage identical to vertical swing

DISINTIGRATOR
    • Behaves like a heavy cannon shot except:
        • Uses disintegrator suscept. instead of electrical susceptibility
        • Different special effects for a kill with it

BRAIN JAMMER/ROBOT RESTRAINER
    • Brain Jammer only works on non-robot aliens
    • Robot Restrainer only works on robot aliens
    • Same effect as an immobilizer but sends out an altered blaster shot
    • Lasts (4 * jammability rating) time units
    • Blast hitting odds works exactly like any other shot
    • Other characters/robots in group can block but it never has an effect
    • Neither have any effect if the alien is already Immobilized
    • Both are additive if the alien is already jammed/restrained

IMMOBILIZER
    • Always lands on the square you aim at
    • When an immobilizer is thrown, the following things can happen:
        • It falls on an empty square
        • It envelops an alien but is not strong enough to hold it
        • It envelops an alien and holds it
    • It lasts for (immobilizability rating * 4) time units
    • If the alien is already immobile, it replaces the duration
    • If the alien is jammed/restrained/blind, immobile overrides the status

SONIC GRENADE
    • Always lands on the square you aim at
    • When an sonic grenade is thrown, the following things can happen:
        • It explodes but nothing is caught in the blast
        • It explodes and damages aliens in blast area (always)
    • Raw Pdamage = energy use of grenade
    • Reduce damage by Pshield amount
    • Use grenade susceptibility to adjust damage amount


ENERGY
    • Always hits the squares that were aimed at.
    • Different percentages of energy are absorbed by the ceiling, depending on the type of energy thrown.
    • The juicer can't throw more than 25% of his energy capacity.  This will be enforced in the command entry phase.  The reason for this limitation should be explained in the manual.

ENERGY (ELECTRICAL)
    • Raw damage = 75% of energy thrown
    • Reduce damage by Eshield amount
    • Use electrical susceptibility to adjust damage amount

ENERGY (HEAT)
    • Raw damage = 50% of energy thrown
    • Reduce by Pshield amount
    • Use heat suscept. to adjust damage

ENERGY (LIGHT)
    SUS = 0.00 [Never]
        = 0.10 [Little]
        = 0.25 [Some]
        = 1.00 [Very]
    PER = 3.60 [36 / 10]
        = 0.90 [18 / 20]
        = 0.40 [12 / 30]
        = 0.22 [09 / 40]
        = 0.14 [07 / 50]
        = 0.10 [06 / 60]
TIME = (25% of energy thrown) * PER * SUS

NOTES:  Light energy does not cause any damage.  Time units in PER is based on upper reflex of alien being hit.








ALIEN ATTACK TYPES

ALIEN SHOT HITTING
    • CHARACTER
        • IF PARRYING OR MOVING
        • IF NOT PARRYING OR MOVING
    • ANOTHER ALIEN

ALIEN SWING HITTING CHARACTER
• Odds of hitting character:
           BASE = 40.00 [% odds of hitting when all else is equal]
          DIFF = UpReflexalien - UpReflexcharacter
         ODDS = ((BASE + DIFF) MAX 0) MIN 99

NOTES:  Works almost the same as a character swing.

• If Swing hits character, check if alien can inflict a status based on STATUS INFLICTED.  If they can, use INFLICTING ABILITY odds in 99 to determine if the character is inflicted with a status.  If a status is inflicted, use the top two bits of STATUS INFLICTED to determine how long the status should last.  MORE TO BE ADDED LATER!!!  *** Remember that some status last longer than the battle and some only last a number of rounds or the length of the battle, which ever is shorter.


IDENTIFYING BY SQUARE/BY AREA
• Odds of being identified:
               BASE =  INTELLIGENCEcurrent
    SIZE = 0.80 [Tiny (0)]
    = 0.90 [Small (1)]
    = 1.00 [Normal (2)]
    = 1.10 [Big (3)]
    DIST = 1.30 - (DISTANCE / 10)
    TIME = 1.00 + (2 * ((ROUND + 1) MIN 5 /10))
    ODDS = BASE * SIZE * DIST * TIME

NOTES:  If identifying the entire area, use the same calculations but divide it by the number of time units it takes to do a one square identify.  Remember to look at the status of the identifying android to make sure that he would be capable of doing an identify (including rundown).  At the beginning of each round, automatically identify any aliens that the android would be able to more than 90% of the time but only if a capable android is present.  When doing an area scan, only do the scan every other time unit.


SUPRISING
    • One in four chance of even doing surprise checking
    • X = (IQcurrent - IQinitial) / 2 + sight range (0 to 45)
    • X = (X * 1.3) if organic or robot detector    (0 to 58)
    • X = (X * 1.5) if vibration sensor present (0 to 67)

Odds in 99 of character being surprised is monster's ability to do so - X.
Odds in 99 of monster being surprised is monster's ability to be + X.

NOTES:  Intelligence refers to that of the group's android.
*** Take into account the absence or disability of the android.
