# COUNCIL LOGS

During their mission into the TRACC station to change the Core Computer back to its original programming, the Council of Five left a written record of their explorations in the form of log entries.  These log entries are left throughout the station for the player to find.  In addition to telling a story, they are used to give the player hints and suggestions as to how to handle various situations that they come across during the course of the game.

# COUNCIL OF FIVE

## Ambassador Miles P. Lambert
COUNCIL MEMBER - Human - male - 79 years old
- Is good friends with Ambassador Lout-e-Umm (Orn).
- Gives antidote to some illness that isn't available in the arsenal until that piece of information is found.  Deneb council member helps.
- The group designated mapper.
- Loves to make predictions and is strangely accurate.
- Second to die.  Where ever we think that accurate maps should stop.

## Ambassador Lout-e-Umm
COUNCIL MEMBER - Orn - male - Extremely old
- The other council members practically insisted that he stay behind, but he would not.
- Frail by Ornese standards - still strongest of the council members
- Somewhat of a mad-dog in battle, surprises the rest of the council with his heroics.
- A bottomless pit of useful information - always seems to know what needs to be known.
- Dies in grand finale

## Ambassador Axang-Wyrrn
COUNCIL MEMBER - Xxtys - Other - young
- Youngest of group and very aware of it, almost embarrassed to Head of the Council.
- Absolutely brilliant, even by Xxtys standards.
- Picked in their early childhood for inherent diplomatic and leadership abilities, and groomed for just such a job as Council Head.
- Although they sometimes doubts their leadership abilities, the rest of the council would follow them anywhere, with out hesitation.
- Humble.
- Tells of the actual existence of the Element Keys in their log.
- Dies in grand finale

## Ambassador Klikx
COUNCIL MEMBER - Stilicx - Female - 160 years old
- She was pretty close friends with Ossnour Buuuhq (Eltanin), some of the group are keeping a close eye on her, thinking that she may have a clouded judgement - Gim thinks she is a spy.
- This is not the original Ambassador from Stilicx - he died of natural causes and Klikx was elected (not by council) in his place.  The rest of council doesn't know/trust her as well.  This changes.
- A little bitty person, but Total death commando in battle.
- Gives hints on how to kill certain aliens, battle techniques, etc.
- Dies in grand finale

## Ambassador Banah Lumna Gim
COUNCIL MEMBER - Deneb - Male - middle aged
- Kind of a closet Zoologist in spare time-this knowledge comes in mighty handy.
- The only Linguist in the group
- Has family. First to die. About Shell 3. Leave message for when dies.

Note:  These are the two designers of the TRACC station that were stranded there when the disaster struck.  The information that these two people leave for the player is in different form (on data cards) and of different nature, since these people know what went wrong because they were there when it happened, unlike the Council.

## Professor Alosf Daaahr
Eltanin - Female - unknown age - computer/linguistics expert
- Gives analysis of computer reprogramming just through observation of activities in the TRACC Station - couldn't get to the core because Element Door had already been activated.
- Information in form of Data Cards.
- Doesn't have weapon at first
- Professor Alosf Daaahr dies shortly after because she must travel in the open and it is more dangerous.  Her data cards stop around shell 3.

## piwhM
Adharan - male - unknown age - structural engineer
- Information in form of Data Cards.
- This is where all info about Floor Plans, Structure, etc. are found.
- Helped Alosf Daaahr escape through access ducts and such.
- Doesn't have weapon at first.
- All he really knows about the Element door is that it is impenetrable without the Element Keys - knows how it was built but can't jimmy it.
- Engineer piwhM's data card information ends near the end of shell 2.  He gets killed by an alien to be named later.

## OTHER PERSONEL
## Ambassador tramhR
COUNCIL MEMBER (DEAD) - Adharan - Male - unknown age

## Ambassador Ossnour Buuunq
COUNCIL MEMBER (DEAD) - Eltanin - Female - fairly old

# PYLON MESSAGES

### **Alliance Council Log: Council Head - Ambassador Axang-Wyrrn**
#### *Entry 1: Standard 4539/5/88*

I think we have made a mistake in coming here without more preparation.  Ambassador Umm was very persuasive in his 'act now, before its too late' stance, but I now wonder if he were younger - would he be so quick to throw his life away on this foolish expedition.  Still ... he bolsters the group; what charisma - what energy!  He out lasts us all, and I must be one tenth his age.

They all look to me for guidance.  It distresses me; I know as little of this Station as the rest of the Council.  We should have been more involved in its construction.

*Shell 1, face 2, near a face change in main hall, need translation on some messages*

### **Personal Log: Ambassador Lambert**
#### *Standard 4539/5/88*

Ambassador Wyrrn has attached one of our magnetic security boxes to the wall where we have camped.  These Council Log Entries, along with any personal log entries will go into the box to help any who follow.  To preserve our secrecy;  we opted for this "bread crumbs trail" type information instead of sending it back.

We have reached what I have termed a "Face Change".  None of us knew how it operated; or even what it was until an unidentified robot came by and wheeled right in - and onto the next face of the "cube".  Strange.  It obviously was going somewhere - a programed assignment - but what?  At least the robot population isn't attacking us like the aliens are.

We didn't know this Station was so spacious,  in fact none of us really knew anything about it.  How could we have left this valuable knowledge in so few minds?

### **Personal Log: Ambassador Klikx**
#### *Standard 4539/5/88*

I am tired.  Four minor skirmishes and I am feeling old.  It has been a long time since I have used a Lasbeam, I hope my battle reflexes return soon - a lot depends on it.  And I must revenge Ossnour's death.  Wyrnn and Lambert were not aware of how much I was covering for them in the last battle.  The other Council Members would not consider bringing Strength and Reflex, but I have less to lose than most and my guess is; we will not return.  I will use them if needed.

### **Personal Log: Ambassador Banah Lumna Gim**
#### *Standard 4539/5/88*

I believe there is a traitor within the Council group.  Too much of the Alliance's actions were known by the enemy.  I haven't talked to anyone else about my suspicions, because I do not know who I can trust.

Ambassador Klikx is the least known to me, and she tops my list of likely spies.  She apparently has had military training, and became a Council Member just before the disaster.  These things along with her friendship with Ambassador Buuuhq, and her numerous visits to Eltanin, make her highly suspicious.

I will try and learn more from her log entries if I can.  Lambert's entry is strange to me, I guess my (English?) is not as good as I thought.  Bread crumb trail?  I do not understand.

### **Personal Log: Ambassador Lout-e-Umm**
#### *Standard 4539/5/92*

I am on [watch] as the Council rests.  Power is full, and the battles are light.  We had a tough time fighting some molecularizing worms which "phazed" through the walls!  [Wish] I could take back a tissue sample and examine it.

As I watch, a group of monoptic biped-type aliens are installing a mechanism [of sorts] ... behind the  wall panels?  They either don't know we are here, or they choose to ignore us.  Most aliens and robots have ignored us so far.  All of them seem to have purpose that is for sure, but who is directing them;  if anyone is?  And why?

The Council still has not found the way down to what Miles says will be an inner "shell" similar to this one, only smaller.  Miles the predictor - he makes me feel young.  He is mapping the station for us.  Gravity!  If only the maps were not lost on [Eltanin], it would save us valuable time.  The [Eltannians] and their pride just might be the ruin of us all.  They should not have been allowed to keep things secret for so long.  Knowledge is to give - not to conceal.

The Station is  worthy of pride.  PiwhM, the [master] builder (may he still live), has chosen an odd construction material;  our laser blaster shots have no ill effect on them.  [In fact] they simply bounce off - I have never witnessed anything like it.  Klikx uses this ricochet effect almost too well, her military training was extensive, I believe.

### **Personal Log: Ambassador Banah Lumna Gim**
#### *Standard 4539/5/92*

Lout-e-Umm woke me to discuss the aliens that he has been observing.  I have never seen them before.  They appear fairly intelligent, and are not in any text that I have read.  An unrecorded alien - a Zoologist's dream.  I have counted more than 10 different aliens on the Station in the short time that we have been here.  Some are familiar to me:

We seem to kill everything in sight.  It makes my fur stand on up when I am forced to use my weapon.

It is not so much to ask that I die well, honorably fighting the evil that has destroyed so much.  But it is difficult to conflict with my personal beliefs to do so.  I will try to aid the group in other ways.

I miss Walush and little Damur.  It hurts me that I will not see them again.

It might just be my imagination, but Klikx seems to go through each battle unscathed.  It is almost as though the aliens do not attack her as much as the rest.

### **Personal Log: Ambassador Banah Lumna Gim**
#### *Standard 4539/5/95*

Luck is with us!  We have found the way down.  It's an elevator Lambert has discovered and scouted out for the group.  He says it will transport us between three "shells".  As I write this log entry, he and Ambassador Wyrrn are debating bypassing the second "shell" to save time.     That might be a wise choice.  The alien population here have become increasingly hostile and aggressive.  Alien attacks per siting have almost doubled since our arrival here.  It is strange - aliens which have a mark029 industrial rating but have weapons and equipment in the mark052 range.  One unidentified alien which lived under the floor panels had a blaster with Vegan death-ritual markings on it.

I believe that the aliens have established their territories more firmly, and this has led to the increase of attacks on us.  If the frequency of the alien attacks increases proportionally we'd be better off skipping the second shell.

### **Alliance Council Log: Council Head - Ambassador Axang-Wyrrn**
#### *Entry 2: Standard 4539/5/95*

The battles are increasingly difficult for the group.  The danger is to great, I must tell those who may follow about gaining entrance to the Core Computer.  The Element Door is (or was) the sole entrance to the center of this station.  Meant to be mostly symbolic, it was a barrier against unauthorized entrance to the Core.  The Element Door must be opened with all of the seven Element Keys.

The Element Keys were material from common substances on the home world of each of the Council Members.  Two of them (the Adharan, Eltanin Keys) have been destroyed, and we don't know what they were made of.  Otherwise, they would be easily duplicated, being a common substance.  However, each Council member kept the substance of their Element Key "secret" so that none could gain access to the Core Computer without the consent of the seven.

This Element Door was to be unveiled (and sealed) by Daaahr and piwhM the day the disaster happened.  I hope that they are still alive, we may need their help to get the Station functioning again.

The Human Element Key was even displayed by Lambert on his desk up until the disaster, and I believe I am the only other Council Member to recognize it as such.  It is just like him to do something like that.  These Keys have become far more important to the Alliance than was ever intended.

We will skip the second shell and move directly onto the third.

### **Alliance Council Log: Council Head - Ambassador Axang-Wyrrn**
#### *Entry 3: Standard 4539/5/95*

Ambassador Gim reads the others' Log entries when they are finished.  I did not know that his training included Linguistics.
        Why would he invade their privacy?

### **Personal Log: Ambassador Klikx**
#### *Standard 4539/5/95*

My fighting skills have returned completely, and the others are improving.  Lout-e-Umm is too impulsive in battle for my taste, of course without him we would not have made it this far.  Still, he takes chances that I never would, and it will kill him soon.  I owe him my life from last battle when my endurance failed me.  How does he do it?  I know that the gravity on the Station feels like half normal to him, but he is so old.  His strength is surprising - I saw him crush the exo-skeleton of one of those six-clawed insectoids with his bare hands.

The strangest life form that we have seen on the Station yet was some sort of micro-organisms; millions of them, which inflicted illness on most of the group.  Lout-e-Umm finally burned them with an overload energy-discharge from his blaster.  A chancy maneuver, but it was successful.

### **Personal Log: Ambassador Miles P. Lambert**
#### *Standard 4539/5/95*

I've just returned from my scouting trip to the third shell.  The transport elevator will hold us and our equipment easily.  Judging by the thickness between shells I believe Shell 2 will be 15 by 15 segments on a face, and Shell 3 should be 13 by 13 segments.  I do not know if there is any more shells after three, but my guess is there are.

These floor plans are difficult to map with all of these useless rooms harboring aliens - mostly dangerous.  Not to mention the three dimensional problems created by the Station shape.  Most of the rooms were meant for work and habitation and could be bypassed, but without the floor plans this is turning into a time consuming journey.

### **Personal Log: Ambassador Lout-e-Umm**
#### *Standard 4539/5/96*

Everything is going ill.  We were attacked by a group of robots while we rested.  It is the first time in my [memory] that a robot has intentionally attacked an Alliance Member.  They had been tracking us for some time, [apparently] waiting for us to let down our guard.  Sophisticated programming; and working as a [team]?  I have never witnessed anything like it.

Aliens on this shell match our combat abilities much closer.  It is straining the endurance of the group.  Everyone is existing well, except for Gim.  He is not a [born] warrior.

### **Personal Log: Ambassador Lout-e-Umm**
#### *Standard 4539/5/98*

We did battle with the mind warping aliens with the [cloaks].  One got a hold of my brain!  A terrifying experience; [one minute] I was in [hand to hand] with a man/snake, then I remember Miles leaning over me, with that [expression] he calls "worried".  These Humans are a constant amusement.

I had words with Axang about the battle.  Things did not go well after the alien disabled me.  Gim got very cut up after he was held by one of the mind warpers (he calls them Encephaloids).  Axang says Klikx pulled the group out of it.

It must have been a sight to witness; Axang is not much of a story teller.

### **Alliance Council Log: Council Head - Ambassador Axang-Wyrrn**
#### *Entry 4: Standard 4539/5/98*

Klikx has been taking Reflex.  She was just a blur in that last skirmish.  Her attacks are so precise.  She had better not combine it with Strength, or it will surely kill her.  I do not intend to have this mission fail because of those drugs.  I cannot argue against its use under these circumstances.  If we do not survive this quest there will be little to live for.  I wish she would not use it.  How she came by it I do not know.

The group is solidifying:  Ambassadors Umm and Klikx have taken the primary offensive positions, Ambassador Gim informs us of alien vulnerabilities, Ambassador Lambert maps/heals, and I organize.

### **TRACC Station Log: Council Head - Ambassador Axang-Wyrrn**
#### *Entry 5: Standard 4539/6/00*

This area of shell three is riddled with ceiling problems.  Electrical shorts, and acid dripping through.  What could be causing it?  It makes me wish we had explored the second shell, maybe we could have anticipated this.

The robots on the station have changed from 'inactive' to 'active but non-aggressive', to 'aggressive'.  I am starting to believe that their control system is connected to the Core Computer.  If that is so, then the Core Computer is not "dead".

### **Personal Log: Ambassador Miles P. Lambert**
#### *Standard 4539/6/01*

Umm has helped me map the two transport rooms.  We cannot figure out why they were made.  It could be the enemy's doing, that's what I believe.  All over the station strange aliens have been installing even stranger devices; barriers, weapons lockers, you name it.  This "random" teleportation panel set up is not beyond some of these alien's abilities.

>*(Maps of both rooms)*

After the initial teleportation, Wyrrn jury-rigged this Tesser-wave feed-back device from some equipment she picked up along the way.  It works like magic.

### **Personal Log: Ambassador Klikx**
#### *Standard 4539/6/01*

The drugs are making me tired.  Well, maybe it isn't the drugs ... I just don't know anymore.  My bones ache for a cold wind, and my eyes for the white of Zin landscapes in the afternoon.  I never thought that I would be (home sick), but I miss the joy that the crystal walls of Tyzer City put in my heart.  These metal halls and artificial lights do nothing for me.

### **Personal Log: Ambassador Banah Lumna Gim**
#### *Standard 4539/6/01*

"Magic"?  Miles uses very peculiar words; I must talk with him about it.  It is the one language of the four I have difficulty translating.

I have seen something that makes my stomach turn.  The aliens that we have been calling "sharp shooters" are a gene manipulation breed!  Gene-splicing was banned by the Alliance as unethical and immoral ever since the Gene Plague on Antarese when the Pylo-168 mutation produced a virus that destroyed four lifeforms before an antidote could be found.

The head arrangement of these "sharp shooters" is distinctly that of a Grungee Bi-Polar, but the rest of its body is of different stock, a (humanoid) species.  I wasn't sure until I got a chance to examine a specimen up close.  I believe something terrible is happening.  The 'thing' behind this abomination must be the same as what destroyed the Eltanin and Adhara planets.  There cannot be another being out there with as little respect for life.  I believe it is Naja behind it all.

The lifeforms in the Station have been picked from every system that I have ever studied, and many that I have not.  This must have occurred over a long period of time.  Is he Naja using them for slave stock, or for breeding purposes?  In either case it is an insult to all lifeforms!  Slavery and breeding stock is probably what he has planned for the remaining five Alliance races.

### **Personal Log: Ambassador Lout-e-Umm**
#### *Standard 4539/6/02*

A [few minutes] ago the Council was in battle with [some sort] of webbed creatures, when a strange thing happened.  The Station itself began to shake, and a loud roar built up.  The creatures got frightened [off], and then the sound [faded] away.  I could not locate the source of the disturbance.  And even Axang did not know what it was.

A Triped-series robot got the best of me in that last battle.  I think it was a model IX, the [rapid-fire] version.  A stupid mistake, unworthy of my defensive skills.  Miles did what he could, but the wound goes very deep and it still bleeds.

### **Personal Log: Ambassador Miles P. Lambert**
#### *Standard 4539/6/02*

Lout took a shot in the side of his chest that goes beyond the repair skills of me or my equipment.  Lout has a strong mind.  I know how much pain he is in, it reads on my Diagnoser, but he shows no outward sign of the pain.  I will keep an eye on him in the next few battles to make sure he's alright.

### **Personal Log: Ambassador Klikx**
#### *Standard 4539/6/02*

Lout-e-Umm was almost out of action completely by the end of the last battle.  I nearly overdosed on reflex trying to compensate for the loss of fighting power to the group.  The drugs are making me nervous.  Lambert says that Umm may not recover from the wound if we do not return soon.  I cannot see how we will make it to the center of this station now.

I have noticed that there is some communication between our foes.  I find an attack combination that works well, and when one alien race figures out how to defend against it, they all begin to show this knowledge.

This Lasbeam feels so familiar to my hands once again.  Battle after battle, everybody's adrenaline running high - it reminds me of my days on the training grounds of The Guard.  That was a good time in my life.  I will die on this station; I can feel it.  My life has been full and rich, and I can proudly say that I regret very little of it.  I wish to leave a message for my family to tell them that I love them.  And I wish to tell my son that I chose to come here and defend what I believe in.  He should remember that I want him to guide his life within his own beliefs, whatever they may be.

### **Personal Log: Ambassador Banah Lumna Gim**
#### *Standard 4539/6/02*

I now begin to doubt my earlier convictions about Ambassador Klikx.  She shows now sign of disloyalty to the Alliance in her actions or in her log entries.  And I believe she does not know I am reading the logs, so there is no reason for her to be faking them.  Of course, to achieve as high a status as Council Ambassador to the Alliance, a spy would have to fool a great many people, and would be very good at that deception.

We ran across an Ebkal'ee here on Shell 3.  The Ebkal'ee race, from the Enif star system, petitioned the Alliance for membership consideration then retracted their bid without reason.  That reason is quite plain now.

### **TRACC Station Log: Council Head - Ambassador Axang-Wyrrn**
#### *Entry 6: Standard 4539/6/03*

Our energy reserves are running low, and I do not know how much farther we have to go before reaching the TRACC Computer.  I think we are not going to find the TRACC Computer non-functioning; it has been altered somehow.  I believe it is functioning, but its purpose has somehow been twisted.  These Station robots that we have been fighting are being controlled by a central source, and that can only mean the TRACC Computer.

### **Personal Log: Ambassador Miles P. Lambert**
#### *Standard 4539/6/04*

We have found the elevator that spans the third, fourth, and fifth shells.  I would have liked to have been wrong on that guess.

I think that the shell structure will look like this:

    Shell 1 15 by 15 units
    Shell 2 13 by 13 units
    Shell 3 11 by 11 units
    Shell 4  9 by 9  units
    Core     7 by 7  units?

### **Personal Log: Ambassador Lout-e-Umm**
#### *Standard 4539/6/05*

[Some of] the battles are just a blur to me now.  The bleeding has stopped, but I am weak and tired.

The Council is critically low on power, but Miles has found what seems to be a power source.  The [readings] indicate someone could tap into the source and drain power off.  I have volunteered for the attempt.

### **Personal Log: Ambassador Miles P. Lambert**
#### *Standard 4539/6/05*

Lout has almost killed himself!

I've spent the last half hour trying to revive him with no success.  He has been in a coma like condition since the energy-bleed attempt.  I think he would have made it through the energy transfer without incident if he hadn't lost so much strength from that damn abdominal wound.  He shows no sign of recovering, but I know so little about Ornese body structure it is difficult for me to say for sure what organs have even been effected.

I don't know what will happen to us if Lout-e-Umm dies.  We need his battle expertise, and his wisdom in other matters if we're going to get through here.

And on a more practical note - how are we going to bring him along?  With his weight it would take at least four of us to carry him on a stretcher, if we had one.  Axang is working in that problem.

### **TRACC Station Log: Council Head - Ambassador Axang-Wyrrn**
#### *Entry 7: Standard 4539/6/05*

Klikx and I have rigged a couple of the stasis-shields to work as sort of an anti-gravity platform for Umm to ride on.  Pretty peculiar  Against my better judgement, Klikx will be the one to go without a shield until Umm recovers - If he does.

If Umm dies, he will have at least bought us some time.  We surely would have been doomed without energy for our weapons and armor.

### **Personal Log: Ambassador Miles P. Lambert**
#### *Standard 4539/6/06*

Most of the Council has been inflicted with some sort of disease from the fungus like creatures that inhabit this shell.  Banah says they are intelligent creatures, and he had no recollection of their existence before now.  Klikx came down with the first symptoms while we were still in battle.  Amazingly quick to take hold.  Then each of us, apparently, contracted it from her.  Everybody is now infected except for Axang-Wyrrn.

The symptoms of the disease include:

    1)  Stomach cramps, vomiting, and nausea
    2)  Disorientation (not as much in the Stilicx)
    3)  Violent negative hallucinations.
    4)  ?

All stages are accompanied by a peculiar degeneration of cellular tissue similar to that of certain forms of radiation damage.  Klikx is in what Gim and I have judged to be the third stage of the illness.  Gim and I are nearing the end of the first stage, Lout's condition is unknown, though we are quite certain that he is infected, and is beyond the first stage.

Gim and I have worked out what we believe is an antidote, and will test it on my good friend, Lout-e-Umm, because of his condition...

### **Personal Log continued: Ambassador Miles P. Lambert**
#### *Standard 4539/6/06*

Success!  Not only has Lout-e-Umm been cured of the disease, but has fully awakened from the "coma".  I will administer the antidote to the rest of us, and record its contents on a data card so the Alliance medical facilities can duplicate it - if anyone follows.

>*Data Card in the box.*

*Contains gibberish like medical jargon.  When recovered the proper capsule appears in the arsenal.*

### **TRACC Station Log: Council Head - Ambassador Axang-Wyrrn**
#### *Entry 8: Standard 4539/6/07*

We are no sooner at full strength than another is put out of action.  Miles has been blinded by a blast in the face from an alien using spectral grenades.  I have taken over the mapping.  Miles instructed me on how to read them properly, and as soon as I feel confidant of my skill we will continue.  Gim is assigned to help protect Lambert when we're under attack.

Some aliens have been following us for some time now.  Miles believes them to be those little creatures he refers to as "Gremlins".  I do not understand why he calls them that.

*This Log Box is beat up and the message is partially destroyed.*

### **Personal Log: Ambassador Klikx**
#### *Standard 4539/6/08*

I had another close call with the Strength and Reflex today.  I could not remember when the last time I had used some was, and then I used some again and maybe shouldn't have taken it.  I don't know how much longer I can keep up this pace.  Lambert and Gim are nearly helpless in battle and with Umm out of action for so long, not to mention what that illness did to my system, I am almost worn out trying to protect them.  Maybe it will be better now that Umm is back in action.  In any case I must lay off them for awhile in order to clear my head so I can think clearly.

*Note: Klikx's Log entries are to be poorly worded from here on out, to show how the drugs are effecting her.*

### **TRACC Station Log: Council Head - Ambassador Axang-Wyrrn**
#### *Entry 9: Standard 4539/6/09*

We are getting close to our goal, I can tell.  But, we have suffered some more setbacks in the last couple of days.  I've lost my left hand, and Lambert cannot see to repair it if he could, but worst of all, we lost Ambassador Gim in the last battle.  An arrant shot by Lout-e-Umm put a dormant Inverse alien on the attack, and it shot him down.
        What is more - I think that I've been making mistakes on some of our maps.  I wish that Lambert were healthy.  Now I must protect him.

### **Personal Log: Ambassador Lout-e-Umm**
#### *Standard 4539/6/09*

Banah Lumna Gim is dead.

With Banah protecting Miles we engaged a pack of Inverse aliens and a Pleiades Blinker.  The battle was going well, we had contact with these Blinker aliens [before] and their teleportation skills were not as disturbing to us this time.

The Blinker moved Axang right next to Klikx.  Her Lasbeam attack accidentally caught Axang right above the left hand, and removed it.  This distracted me, and I inadvertently hit one of the Inverse beasts with a full laser shot.  It converted my shot, and fired at Banah.   The blast hit him in the [throat], [mortally] wounding him.  I believe that Miles could have saved him if he were not also injured.

We would like it to be known for the record that Banah Lumna Gim died defending a fellow Council Member.

I will [double] my efforts, to protect the Council, and [bring success] to this mission.

We have another problem concerning the death of Banah.  None of us are sure we know what the Ambassador's Element Key is.  It could be almost any of his [personal] effects, but we do not have space for anything unnecessary, and cannot carry everything.

Axang and I believe that the Gilloitan Element Key is Gim's Prayer [bracelet] worn by all of the Denebian people, but Klikx and Miles think it is a petrified Jun-ba leaf they found mixed in with some of his scanning equipment.  We will take them both.

### **TRACC Station Log: Council Head - Ambassador Axang-Wyrrn**

Testing...one...two...three....  This device is ingeniously designed, considering the equipment and materials that Axang had at her disposal.

I am blind.  Never before have I been without one of my senses for so long a time.  It, well, it is changing me.  I think, anyway.  The battles seem very frightening in the dark.  But, through all of the battle noise, I hear Axang-Wyrrn's voice giving out battle commands in that calm, precise manner of hers.  What a leader she is!  In the battle where she lost her hand, I didn't hear her react at all.  Instead she went right on with the necessary orders.  I had to be told what happened afterwards.

It's too bad about Gim.  We will miss his Xenological skills.

An interesting development - I believe my eyesight is returning!  I actually can see a light differential when I pass my hand in front of my eyes.  I'll wait until I'm sure before telling anyone.

I pronounce my self fit for battle duties!

Slowly, but surely, over the last 24 hours, my eyesight has returned.  I estimate them to be 70% recovered, and improving.  Axang has given me permission to scout ahead a little and see what we have in store for us.  I will take along one of those audio Log-entry devices that Axang has made, to record my observations.  I wonder what is out there ready to be discovered?

*Lambert goes off somewhere to scout and doesn't return.  Find his Log in the form of a Data Card and it explains what he found before he died.*

Axang-Wyrrn is not a very good cryptographer.   Her maps are in error on several places.  I have corrected those that I've found.  Shell 5 map is almost complete and still no transport down onto the next shell.  It still must be ahead.

Some aliens gave me quite a scare a little while ago.  I just ducked out of their sight in time; didn't catch what they were, but I'm sure I couldn't handle them alone.  I've got to be more careful.

# DATA CARDS

note:  this is Lambert's last log entry.  it's in the form of a data card.

I think I found the way down.  At first I thought that I mapped incorrectly, or that Axang had messed up.  But after double checking everything I found that it isn't a mistake at all.  What it is, is sort of a "premature" face change; prematurely changing and instead of changing onto the adjacent face it goes into next Shell, or Level, or whatever is there.

I have tried to map out an illustration of what I think it is like.  I'm about to pass through the face change and then I will know for sure what is...there.  Ha! I was right, the Elements Door!

Oh, ...damn....

*any Information - on data cards - before the middle of shell three must be given by someone else.*

## Time/Date Encoding

Date - 0000/0/00, and if a more specific time is needed it is added on like this:  0000/0/00-000.000

- 000.001                =   .082 seconds
- 000.010                =   .82 seconds
- 000.100                =   8.2 seconds
- 001.000                =   1.36 minutes
- 010.000                =   13.66 minutes
- 100.000                =   2.28 hours

* 0000/0/01               =   22.77 hours
* 0000/0/10               =   9.5 days
* 0000/1/00               =   3 months
* 0001/0/00               =   2.6 years

## NOTES

- On the first few pylons the group can't seem to figure out how to work them.
- Log entries from the council can go right up to the last minute
- Another hearing of the ship noise
- Partial maps could be given of different areas of the station.  They could be in the form of council log entries, other explorers leaving them around, or possibly a control room that gives the structure of station.
- The information seller won't have any information that would be gotten from the council.  He will have information that would probably have been collected from other explorers.  It doesn't necessarily have to be in the form of data cards, but rather paying him and him telling you something.

## TODO

- All references to Ambassador Axang-Wyrrn should gender neutral
- Fix 17x17 versus 15x15 shell inconsistencies
- Consider chaining log entries/pylons with passwords so they're read in the correct order?
- Or, just reorder log entries to match the order they pylons are found?
