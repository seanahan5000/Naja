SWING SQUARES

Flags which squares an alien can swing at in relation to where it is located.

  One wide - SLXR....
  Two wide - SLXCR...
Three wide - SLXCCR..
 Four wide - SLXCCCR.
 Five wide - SLXCCCCR

S = Simultaneous swing flag
    (Can hit with both hands at the same time if set)
X = X coordinate of alien
L = Square to the left of the alien
R = Square to the right of the alien
C = The rest of the squares a wide alien takes up
. = unused bits
