# Naja #

**Naja** is a futuristic fantasy role-playing game for the Apple ][, designed by Sean Callahan (programming) and Richard Nielsen (artwork).  We started on it as 16 year olds in the spring of 1982, and worked through our Senior year of high school.  Development continued full-time from 1983 to 1985, with additional work being done part-time through 1989.

The game was originally designed for the Apple ][+ with 48K memory, but was eventually upgraded to require an 80 column card or Apple //e with 64K.  It covered three floppy disks, six sides total, with its own custom copy protection system.

Naja's design was heavily influenced by the game Wizardry by Sir-Tech.  The use of line tunnels, hand-drawn maps on graph paper, and text-based fight narration are conventions that we adopted from Wizardry and, to a lesser degree, Ultima.  After many hours playing Wizardry, we thought we could do better and added features we considered innovative for the time.

* A futuristic sci-fi theme and new classes instead of typical D&D/LotR theme.
* Full-screen, six-sided tunnels.
* Monster/alien graphics integrated into the tunnels instead of just overlaid.
* Use of animations and transition effects.
* A unique mapping scheme where each game level is wrapped on the outside of a cube to approximate a spherical space station.  Each cube level contained smaller cube levels, like a Russian nesting doll.

The word Naja comes from the game's villain, which is also the genus name of cobra snakes.  It was later renamed to the easier to understand "Tactical Force Alliance".

**Graphics Simulations Software** was incorporated in 1982 with the original intent of self-publishing Naja.  We eventually decided to publish through an established game company but didn't start actively looking for a publisher until 1988.  We demonstrated the game for publishers at the second-ever Computer Game Developer's Conference (Milpitas, California Holiday Inn, 1988), and then formally submitted it to Electronic Arts, Mediagenic/Activision, Epyx, New World Computing (Might and Magic), and Origin Systems (Ultima).  While we received positive responses to the game, most weren't interested in publishing because it was Apple ][-only and they had moved to simultaneous multi-platform releases, and the Apple ][ was considered a dying platform compared to the PC at that point.  Only Origin Systems showed any interest and started a contract conversation with us, but that later fell through.

A capture of the video tape submitted to publishers can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZTUacbMBF4&t=346s.  Additional materials included the game itself, instruction manual, and a demo disk of aliens and other graphics, all of which is found in this repo.

The sources here are a snapshot of the game in its original/classic form and playable state.  Later modifications attempting to update the look of the game, redo all the maps, and collapse it down to fewer disks have been removed.  The original disk copy protection system has been stripped out so the game will work on standard floppies and under emulation.

Some special encounters (listed below) have been implemented and can be found throughout the game world.  Others are only in the form of images on some of the disk archives.  All designed aliens are included, but no game tuning or balancing has been done.  All aliens fight with the same random, relatively weak stats.

## Building

Sources are assembled using Asm6502 -- a Merlin assembler clone written from scratch.

To build, open a Windows command prompt:
```
setenv.bat
cd naja\build>
boot.bat
```

Build output can be found in naja\bin.

## Running

Download and launch the AppleWin emulator (https://github.com/AppleWin/AppleWin).

In AppleWin Configuration (joystick/speaker icon), set machine type to Apple //e.

- Open drive 1 and select `naja\bin\boot.nib`
- Open drive 2 and select `naja\bin\tracc1.nib`
- Reset

Press any key to stop title screen animation
Press any key to leave signature page

#### General Keys

- Move/turn left: J or `<left-arrow`>
- Move/turn right: K or `<right-arrow`>
- Move up/step forward: A or I or `<up-arrow`>
- Move down/turn around: Z or M or `<down-arrow`>
- Select: `<space`> or `<return`>

NOTE: Naja assumes all upper case input so caps-lock must be enabled at all times for keys to work when running on a //e.  (Naja will run on an ][+, but the up and down arrows will not be available and some debug key combinations won't work.)
