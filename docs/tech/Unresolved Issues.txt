UNRESOLVED ISSUES

• Have some semi-standard dialog box forms
• Plan out the entire game scenario
• Plan modules for monster types
• 128K memory requirements??? Use other 64K as RAM disk???
• Limit the "specialness" of aliens
• Adjust the name NAJA to something more interesting
• Remove (or limit) affect of equipment on character stats and the minimum stat requirement to use them
• Mouse control???
• In fight routine...
    Make probabilities less realistic and more random
    Let them use up their energy if they want
• Take out all delays
• Ignore minor unrealisticnesses
• No more energy use for armor???
• Save some ideas for later
• Lower amount of energy storage available for non-warrior/juicer classes
