# COUNCIL'S EVENTS

- Lambert reports back that he has found the elevators down
- Gives his prediction of how shells are organized - Unn's humorous reaction to this
- Speed is of the essence (Wyrrn) must get down as soon as possible
- Group goes to elevators - they do not work - Wyrrn and Lambert begin working on it
- This takes a while so:
- Unn takes off and explores
    - Finds the damaged area
    - Area is more damaged than it is for the player
    - Hears ship sound? Or too damaged for him to get that near
- Banah sneaks off and finds out information about alien population
    - Investigates the Council's conference room and all the rest, sees Ruuik's troops
    - Things creeping around that haven't been noticed yet
- Klikx goes to the reception room and the view port and sees a Markabian ship outside
    - Ship is on a collision course with station - can't figure out
    - Lambert finds this very interesting
- While waiting for the others to return:
- Lambert goes down in the elevator and gets in trouble (battle)
- Wyrrn decides to "check out some things" and discovers some shipping/building orders that explain to the player why things are so empty
- Wyrrn is monitoring their vitals on WristComp
- Everybody returns and realizing that Lambert is in trouble, they go down to Scientific Level and save him

## Council - Scientific Level

- Lambert is shot up pretty bad, but hey! Medical Lab is nearby.  Needless to say, the group takes him there and heal him up.
- Klikx displayed her skill for the first time - get everybody's reaction to it
    - Banah is not surprised that a spy would have such skill
    - Wyrrn is pleased
    - Klikx feels rusty - surprised at the "do or die" attitude of Unn - doesn't like it
- They head out as a group
- Can't get into Cryogenic Lab
- Visit Hydroponics
    - Get food - not as a need thing, but as an enjoyment thing
    - A lot of cubicles are unfurnished (empty)
    - The Adharan and Eltanin foods are there
    - Guesses on Denebian botanical gardens
        - Drop something down, decide to get it when they are down on that level rather than jump down and risk getting separated.  This should be the result of Lambert's fear of heights.
- Robots begin to start up about now - not attacking yet
- Council "builds" a robot that they program to do surveillance for the Alliance.  They do something to it to make it independent of the Core, and send it on its merry way - it does not return before the Council gets killed, but helps out the player.  Distinguishing marks on it.
- Exploring Photon testing center and get in battle with intelligent alien who turns on the thing as an attack against the Council - they must retreat under its awesome power.  Leave some equipment behind. - Unn is injured.
- Lambert patches everybody up and they head out to the elevators and get lost.
- End up in the damaged area (Plasma Research) where they talk about what caused the damage - speculate: meteor, Markabians, Plasma explosion.
- Give map of how it was supposed to look
- Exit to Living Quarters Level

## Council - Living Quarters

- Discovery of last log entries of Daaahr and piwhM.
- Alien activity is greatly increased and organized.  Robots begin to attack after the group attempts to link up with core and it "spots" them.  The group thinks that their surveillance robot will not return now that the core is aware of them.
- Group splits up again
- Wyrrn and Banah, and Lambert go to the botanical gardens
    - Find Eltanin and Adharan gardens are fully furnished - seal them up to preserve the plant life
    - Can't get into Denebian garden to get fallen equipment back
    - Lambert is blinded in battle before the group gets back together
    - Go to the Nul-Grav Gymnasium, get into battle with some bad asses and Banah gets blown away when protecting Lambert.  The other group members arrive too late to really help.
- Unn and Klikx head out to plasma drip area
    - Hear ship noises - Unn is putting the ship noise together with the ship on collision course and the damaged area, but doesn't tell anyone yet.
    - Visit library to find out anything and find out something of value which will be destroyed by plasma drip by the time the player gets there.
    - There is also something else to find in the library that the Council did not find
    - Hear the distressed calls of the others - rush to help and get there too late
- Group gets back together.  Axang reflects on the combined strength idea
- They put his body in the equipment room and take the wrong key
- Exit to Maintenance Level

## Council - Maintenance

- Lout-e-Unn tries to convert a little energy from the mass converter.  Gets hurt doing it.  Group gets attacked by energy type alien when in the generator room.
- Lambert goes off and scouts out things and gets captured, tortured and thrown into the cell block - this is where the group finds him.
- Shortly after saving Lambert, the Council is overwhelmed by an opponent and runs for it - eventually gets trapped in a dead end.
- Klikx cuts through the wall with her Lasbeam sword and into the ventilation system.  The core, aware of this, turns it on full blast and Lambert, in his weakened state is sucked down and disintegrated at the heating pump (how is his key saved?)
- Elevator won't go down to core level so group "hot wires" it.
- Group reprograms the element door to take just five keys.  Either the door should have one large place to put the elements; or it should look like it was intend to take 7 keys, but has been crudely altered.
- they can't get it to work (they have the wrong Denebian key) and they try to get the station computer to override the door.  This is the end of the Council's logs.

This is the beginning of what the core remembers.  There are no log entries of this.

- The core opens the element door and "invites them in".
- Waiting for the group is a ton of Markabians.
- Markabians are trying to capture the council.  Not fighting full force.


*SMC: Originally, council could get into most of TRACC computer network.  Core eventually shuts them out.  Now, council logs are the only thing they do on it.  Need some reason for core not to be able to get at it.*
