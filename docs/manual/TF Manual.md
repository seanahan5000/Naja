## THE HISTORY OF THE TACTICAL FORCE (NEWEST)

To understand why the Alliance Tactical Force was formed, one must first understand the Council of Seven.

The Human race, as you well know, has ventured far out into space and discovered a variety of intelligent life forms, both friendly and hostile.  They have formed trade pacts and alliances with six other planets, culminating in the formation of The Council of Seven; A council consisting of one elected representative from each of the seven races, charged with leading The Alliance.  Through this alliance, the races have been able to pool their strength to defend against the increasingly frequent attacks from the very hostile Markabian race, populating several planets in the 24 - 00  sector.  But while the strength of the Markabians has grown, that of The Alliance races has remained constant; Stagnating because of the shear distances between their planets, and the seven-way language barrier.

>*(tactical force boundaries chart)*

The Alliance races were still able to defend themselves from the Markabians, but this advantage was slipping.  Even now, fragmented intelligence reports told of powerful new weapons the Markabians were developing, one supposedly capable of focusing the energy of a star and literally burning off the surface of a planet.  Many of these reports were dismissed as exaggerations or falsehoods, but nonetheless they made the need for a solution seem all the more critical.

For this reason, The Council of Seven began to organize work on an interstellar communication and translation space station of such versatility and speed as to effectively eliminate these distance and communication problems.

The TRAnslation and Communication Computer, or TRACC station as it came to be known, progressed on schedule, and finally neared completion.

The brains behind the scene that were chiefly responsible for the design of the TRACC station were the renowned computer/linguistics expert, Alosf Daaahr, from the Eltanin star system; working in tandem with piwyM, the structural  specialist from the Adharan sector.

The TRACC Station was designed to house the translation computers and communication equipment as well as the Alliance administration staff.  It was designed for self-sufficient operation.  Repair and Maintenance robots, controlled by the Core computer, were equipped to handle almost every conceivable malfunction.

>*(drawings of flags, emblems, insignias)*

When the unveiling day finally arrived, the excitement of the people of all races was at fever pitch as The Council of Seven prepared to do the first seven-way, instantaneous, interplanetary communication with simul-translation.  With each of the Council on their home world, the TRACC Station began its work and all the free people heard their leader speak with the other Council members in their native tongues.  Alosf Daaahr and piwyM were in the TRACC Station to make last minute adjustments in the equipment and oversee the whole ceremony.

But just as the celebrating began, the transmission from Eltanin stopped.  After a few moments, all transmissions were replaced with the voice of a Markabian warrior.  The viewers' shock, as the Markabian thanked The Council of Seven for providing the means for their demonstration of power, turned to horror as they saw the Adharan planet destroyed by a huge, indescribable weapon.  But as the voice of the Markabian tried to threaten the other five races into surrendering, this weapon exploded for no known reason.  With their bargaining position suddenly altered the voice abruptly stopped and the TRACC station signal went dead.

The Council members, stunned by the events that had transpired, met secretly aboard the Alliance star cruiser Mothership to discuss the present situation.  It is there they launched their mission into the silent TRACC Station, trying to set right the damage they felt responsible for.  The Council of Five entered the Station but never returned.

The fate of The Council remains unknown while the TRACC station continues its silence.  Preliminary explorations indicate that it has become infested with all forms of hostile alien life, source unknown.  Without the the TRACC station functioning to combine The Alliance forces, each race will surely be crushed by the Markabians, one by one.  The top priority of the Tactical Force Academy is to get the TRACC Station working.

## THE HISTORY OF THE TACTICAL FORCE (OLD)

To understand why the Five Planets Tactical Force was formed, one must first understand The Alliance of the Seven Worlds, and the Council of Seven.

The Council of Seven, members which were the elected leaders of seven free worlds, formed the treaty which eventually became The Alliance of the Seven Worlds.  This treaty was designed to unite the individual powers of the planets, increase trade on the open market, and to heighten the sharing of cultural and technical information among the races involved.  Within a few years all the free worlds began to benefit from it.

>*(tactical force boundaries chart)*

Pirate like groups of many lifeforms sprang up and fed off of the wealth and prosperity of the Alliance.  It was about this same time that the Council noticed the technical growth of a region outside the Alliance's boundaries which supported an intelligent race.  For many years the Council successfully combined the strength of the seven worlds, when needed, to fight off the rebel uprisings, and parasitic activity, but in the few minor conflicts that occurred, very little contact with this new alien race - the Markabians - was made, though they were suspected of military, and monetary backing in several incidences.  Even now there is not much known about this race.  Then came the scouting reports telling of the new Markabian leader behind all of the attacks against the Alliance, but they were passed over with little notice.  After all, the new Alliance was growing strong, and small dictators in faraway places did not concerned the Council.

>*(drawings of flags, emblems, insignias)*

The Council began the outlines of its first major interplanetary project, the TRanslation And Communication Computer station--the TRACC station.  The design of the TRACC station, a highly efficient translation and communication relay base, was to strengthen planetary relations by uniting them verbally.  The major part of the design of the TRACC station was done by the renowned computer/linguistics expert, Alosf Daaahr, from the Eltanin star system.  She, working in tandem with piwyM, the structural  specialist from the Adharan sector kept the Council informed about the progress of the TRACC Station construction.  Fourteen Earth years it took to be completed - the Station was now fully tested and activated when disaster struck.

The day of the TRACC Station unveiling came, and each Council member was at their home world to participate in the first Station-aided communication.  Communication without time delay, across interstellar distances, with simultaneous translation.  Alosf Daaahr and piwyM were in the TRACC Station to participate in a surprise opening ceremony which was to be simulcast on each of the Seven worlds.  None saw or heard the ceremony, because the TRACC Station suddenly went silent.  The status of Daaahr and piwyM - unknown.

In the turmoil surrounding the silence - the unthinkable occurred.  The Council leader called a meeting but when the Eltanin and Adharan representatives did not arrive the five other council members went to Adhara.  All they found was a burnt cinder where there used to be a fertile, populated planet.  The inhabited planets in the Eltanin and Adhara systems were obliterated;  completely destroyed.  Two of the Council members and nearly 75 billion people were killed.

The remaining Council members met in secret aboard the Alliance star cruiser Mothership to discuss the present situation.  It is there that they programmed the Council Computer, and launched their ill-fated quest into the silent TRACC Station;  to try and set right the damage they felt responsible for.  The Council of Five apparently intended their mission be secret to prevent the enemy from learning their intention - and some how preventing their success.

Leaving behind the pre-programed Council Computer to help rule in their absence, the Council entered the Station and did not returned.  In the Council Computer the plans for the academy you now attend, The Five Planets Tactical Force , were set forth in the event of the Council's death or loss.

We do not know what happened to the TRACC Station, only that it is not functioning, and that its activation is vital to the survival of the Alliance.  We also know that the destruction of Eltanin and Adharan planets was somehow connected to the TRACC Station shut down.  It was possibly done to destroy the construction and layout plans of the TRACC Station which were kept on the planets.   It is believed that these attacks are coming from Markab, and the new Markabian ruler, though the Alliance cannot verify their involvement in any of this.  Informants tell us the ruler's name is Naja.

    Priorities of the Tactical Force Academy:
        1)  Get the TRACC Station working,
        2)  Find out the fate of the Council of Five, and
        3)  Verify Markabian involvement.

## THE HISTORY OF THE TACTICAL FORCE (OLDEST)

To understand the reasoning behind the formation of the Five Planets Tactical Force, one must first understand the Alliance of the Five Free Worlds and the Council of Five, which had their origins in the seven worlds.

The Alliance of the Seven Worlds, the result of a treaty among the leaders of the seven free worlds (called The Council of Seven), was designed to unite the individual powers of the planets.  This union was designed to increase trade on the open market and to heighten the sharing of cultural and technical information among these races.  Within a few years all the free worlds began to benefit from the treaty.

>*(tactical force boundaries chart)*

It was about this same time that the Council noticed the technical and population growth of a region outside the Alliance's boundaries which supported an intelligent, but evil race.  For many years the Council successfully combined the strength of the seven worlds, when needed, to fight off the power in the Markab star system.  In the few minor conflicts that occurred, very little contact with the Markabians was made, and even now there is not much known about this race.  There were reports from scouts telling of the new Markabian leader behind all of the attacks launched against the Alliance, but they were passed over without much notice.  After all, the new Alliance was growing strong, and small dictators in faraway places concerned the Council little.

The Council began the outlines of its first major interplanetary project, the TRanslation And Communication Computer station--the TRACC station.  The design of the TRACC station, a highly efficient translation and communication relay base, was to strengthen planetary relations by uniting them verbally.  The major part of the work on the TRACC station was completed by the renowned Alosf Daaahr from the Eltanin star system.  Her expert engineering skill and unique gift for languages allowed her to develop TRANS, the most advanced translation computer ever known among the Alliance worlds.  TRANS was installed in the center of the cubical TRACC station, and was later to be known as the Core Computer because of its location.  The Core Computer was originally protected by the 7-orbs door which blocked the single entry way to the core.  The 7-orbs door required seven spherical orb keys for access.  One orb key was then given to each Council member, thereby making access to the Core Computer impossible without the consent of the Seven Free World leaders.

>*(drawings of flags, emblems, insignias)*

Naja, the ruthless leader of the Markabian forces, of whom scout reports had spoken, became aware of the TRACC station and its importance to the unity of the Seven Free Worlds.  Naja was concerned that the Alliance would use their combined strength to overthrow him.  That fear drove him to terrible heights of evil.  Using a newly developed weapon, Naja directed its force at the home sectors of the two builders of the TRACC station, destroying the planets completely.  Shortly after the obliteration of the inhabited planets in the Eltanin and Adhara sectors, Naja's forces swarmed into the TRACC station, and it became inoperable soon afterwards.  In doing this, Naja had hoped to destroy the morale and ambitions of the Alliance.

Fortunately for the Alliance, when Adhara imploded, a fragment of the planet struck Naja's weapon and destroyed it.

After the initial shock of these events had subsided, the Council of Five (the remaining members of the Council of Seven) met and discussed the present situation.  Among other things, the Council of Five decided that an attempt was to be made to repair the Core Computer (presumed damaged by Naja's attack on the Station).

Taking with them the remaining Orb Keys (two of the seven Orb Keys had been destroyed with their owners when Naja destroyed Adhara and Eltanin), the five members entered the TRACC Station and found that the computer was not "inactive" as originally thought, but was simply reprogrammed with Naja's own evil programs.  They also found that the alien population in the station had drastically increased as a result of Naja's reprogramming of the robots responsible for alien pest control.  As the five Council members advanced into the now-hostile TRACC Station, they discovered that ALL of the robots originally put in the Station for the purpose of maintaining it had been reprogrammed by Naja to fight against any member of the Alliance trying to reach the Core of the Station.

Reports came back to the Five Planets telling of the Council's progress.  Its members advanced steadily until they arrived at the Door of Seven Orbs.  It wasn't immediately accessible because the Council no longer had two of the Seven Orbs.  Yet the Council thought it could be opened and began their work on the door.  After several days it was open, at which point the council reprogrammed it to function with just the five remaining Orbs.  Upon entering the core, the Council unexpectedly met Naja.  The Council members were well-prepared for normal battle, but had not anticipated the presence of Naja.  Naja's power was beyond belief, and though the Council fought well, in the end they perished.  Among optimists, it is said that Naja did not utterly destroy the group; instead, he atomically reduced them and took the compressed Council back to Markab for display in his trophy room.  This, of course, has never been verified.

While the details of Naja's battle with the Council remain unclear, a couple of facts are known.  First, Naja evidently has another entrance to the Core, as yet undiscovered by the Alliance.  Second, THE FIVE REMAINING ORBS WERE SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE STATION when the Council fell.

Shortly after the devastating news was heard the formation of the academy you now attend, The Five Planets Tactical Force, was established:  Knowing the danger of their mission to activate the Core Computer, the Council of Five had set forth the plans for the Tactical Force, to be established in the event of their deaths or disappearance.  Upon joining the Five Planets Tactical Force, you must commit yourself to the recovery of the Five Orbs, the reprogramming of the Core Computer, and the defeat of Naja.  These are the tasks of Tactical Force.

## RACES

If you intend to pursue an Academy career, you will be in close association with many alien life forms.  The five common humanoid life forms comprising the Tactical Force are Denebians, Humans, Ornese, Stilicxs, and Xxtys, all of whom live under the Alliance administration boundaries.

>*(group drawing of races)*

The five races are oxygen-breathing, water-consuming omnivores.  In fact, the races differ only slightly on a structural level.  The following descriptions are to aid you in your acceptance and understanding of the five races by showing relevant differences among them.

**DENEB**ians (da neeb ee yans) have four arms and hands in addition to their legs which gives them a very peculiar appearance, though they are similar to humans in most other biological aspects.  They are very agile, but rather dull-witted and physically weak.  Their lack of strength is the result of relatively low gravitation on their native planet, Giloitt.  It is the third of twelve planets in the Rigel system (see Chart xx).  It has a pull of .45 Standard Gravitational Units (SGU's).  The only habitable region is a huge tropical continent which surrounds the planet at its equator like a belt.  That, and the slight tilt of the planet (4.5 degrees), makes Giloitt virtually season-less.

>*(drawing of giloitt)*

The Denebians know only of their tropical summer and the word "season" is not in the Denebian language.  The Denebs have an average height of 2.26 meters and an average weight of 73 kilograms.  The Deneb's biggest contribution to the Alliance has been their achievements in the medical sciences: biology, ecology, and botany.  It isn't so surprising, then, to note that the Denebian life expectancy is 305 Standard Earth Years (SEY's).  They reach maturity at 23.  Distinct markings include a strip of fur that runs from the head to the lower back.

**HUMAN**s (HYOO munz), though they do not shine in any one area, control a surprisingly high overall average as far as their beginning physical and mental statistics are concerned.  They are highly credited for their contribution of weaponry and military strategy to the Alliance without which it would surely be in worse shape.  Their native world is Earth, the fourth planet of the Sol star system.  It has a gravitational pull of 1.0 SGU's.  Humans average 1.91 meters in height and 84 kilograms in weight.  They have a life expectancy of 145 SEY's.

**ORN**ese are by far the physically strongest of the five races, because of their evolutionary growth on a tremendously strong gravity-pull planet (1.82 SGU's).  The Ornese planet, Touhtaa, has 16 moons, one of which is larger than earth.  Their average height is 1.57 meters, and they weigh in at a hefty 1050 kilograms on average.  The Ornese are not fat; their height-weight ratio is due to a unique high-density cell structure.  Extreme strength has taken nothing away from their mental aptitude.  They are very intelligent.  The Ornese knowledge of structural engineering and space ship travel has been a great aid to the Alliance.  This expertise is not surprising when one thinks of what technological advances had to be made in order to build stable structures and launch ships off the face of a planet with a gravity like that of Touhtaa.

**STILICX**s (sta LIKS) have been in space the longest.  They were aware of all of the other members of the Alliance far before the reverse was true.  They also accumulated a tremendous amount of knowledge about chemistry and available raw materials by the time the Alliance was formed.  Their average height is 1.83 meters, and their average weight is 160 kilograms.  Their intelligence and strength abilities are similar to those of humans, though their reflexes are not as sharp.  Stilicxs have a crystaline type cell structure, which provides them with a means of resisting the extremely frigid climate of their native planet, Zin.  Located in the Ankaa star system, Zin was the native world of the Stilicxs; they presently occupy 34 planets and moons.

>*(drawing of zin)*

Zin has a gravity pull of 1.08 SGU's.  Stilicxs are the most populous of the Alliance races, and the average life is 234 years long.  The Stilicxian diet is quite peculiar and includes meal supplements of crystalline-based ore found only on Zin.  This material is also the basis of the Stilicxian religion.

**XXTYS** (ZY tees), commonly referred to as "techs", are a highly intelligent race.  Their intelligence has indirectly hampered their biological "natural selection" process.  The Xxtys perfected the replacement of "defective" body parts with mechanical equivalents, thus saving lives and allowing bodily defects to be passed on to the next generation, where they would also need replacing.  This was common practice for many generations.  And now, though the Xxtys are mentally superior (the result of artificial intelligence selection), their physical attributes have deteriorated.  Their average height is 1.77 meters and their average weight is 59 kilograms.

>*(drawing of city planet)*

Bellatrix is the techs' star system.  Their planet (its name, more an exclamation than a title, is untranslatable) has a gravity of .63 SGU's.  The Xxtys have contributed their vast knowledge of robotics and computers to the Alliance.

## PROFESSIONAL STATUS

When speaking to other cadets (of all races) it is proper to recognize professional standing.  There are six professions presently recognized by the Five Planets Tactical Force.  They are: Android, Cybernate, Electro-physicist, Physician, Warrior, and Electro-Medic.

**ANDROID**s can read and speak a variety of languages.  This skill might prove invaluable when dealing with the TRanslation And Communication Computer.  As a result of their planetary zoological studies, Androids have the the ability to identify alien and robot opponents.  They can operate all scanning equipment in accordance with their ability, increasing the group's element of surprise.  Androids are usually irrepressibly logical, meticulous, and observant.  Seldom panicky, Androids never appear to get ruffled or distracted in battle.

**CYBERNATE**s have one field of knowledge: robotics.  They spend their time learning robot programming, deprogramming, robotic engineering, robot construction, and the utilization of such knowledge under the war-like conditions of the TRACC Station.  Cybernates must be wealthy enough to purchase a robot with which to work, for a Cybernate is somewhat at a loss without one.  They can resort to the use of the lesser weapons available to warriors, but it is not advised.  Cybernates tend to be straight talking but extremely defensive where their robots are concerned.

**ELECTRO-PHYSICIST**s, or "Juicers" as they are commonly referred to, are a powerful asset to any group.  A Juicer's primary function is the storage and distribution of energy for the frequent trips into the TRACC Station.  They can emit their stored energy under safe conditions to fellow cadets in need, or they can "throw" it in a harmful way at enemy aliens and robots.  Juicers can use the lesser weapons but a straightforward emission of their energy is more versatile than altered energy like that of a blaster or laser sword.  Juicers tend to be steady and dependable in character.  They are probably the easiest profession to spot, for they crackle when they walk and tend to glow when fully charged.

**PHYSICIAN**s are also an essential part of any exploration group.  They are skilled in the art of healing, and their services are necessary to ailing group members.  An abundance of healing equipment is available to Physicians of capable intelligence levels.  In accordance with the nature of their study, Physicians are forbidden to use military equipment, except certain defensive articles.  The most common character trait found in Physicians is a "steady-handedness" under extreme pressure situations,  like those in battle.  Denebians make excellent Physicians because their extra hands allow them to carry excess medical equipment, as well as compressed cadets.

**WARRIOR**s study, practice, and perfect the skills of physical combat.  Including hand-to-hand combat, battle strategies, and the skilled use of all military weapons and protective devices.  The Xxtys race has never put forth a competent cadet of the Warrior profession because of their declining physical attributes.  Warriors are usually cocky, self-centered, and fatalistic.  Though there has never been an incident on the Mothership, untimely deaths seem to follow those who speak ill of warriors.

**ELECTRO-MEDIC**s are essentially Cybernetic Physicians who are adept in the areas of robotics and medicine.  They can both heal organic wounds and repair inorganic body parts, including robots.  Cadets MUST HAVE EXTENSIVE TRAINING AND PRACTICE IN THE PHYSICIAN PROFESSION before attempting the Electro-Medic qualification test.  Electro-Medics cannot own robots because their medical oath does not permit the hurting of another life form.  "Confident" best describes most Electro-Medics.

>*(key command card tear out)*

## MOTHERSHIP

The Mothership is the place where Tactical Force cadets are currently being assigned.  It is the largest, fastest, and most powerful ship in the Tactical Force fleet, with a crew capacity of 12,400 humanoids.  Of the many office complexes on the Mothership, only four concern low-ranking cadets:

>*(little map of all complexes)*

## THE ENROLLMENT COMPLEX

>*(map of enrollment complex)*

The Enrollment Complex Intraship Transport Platform is the place where all beginning cadets will materialize upon transportation to the Mothership, after security clearance.  The platform is labeled on the overhead-view map, of the Enrollment Complex, above.

The Enrollment Complex houses the ENROLLMENT AND TESTING office, and GROUP ASSEMBLY office, as well as the HOMEWORLD SHUTTLE port and the INTRASHIP TRANSPORT platform.  The first place you, as a civilian, will wish to go is the Enrollment and Testing Office.  To get there, use the map above as a guide, and control your movements with the movement keys on page xx.  When you get to the door labeled...

## ENROLLMENT AND TESTING

Walk through.  Once inside the Enrollment and Testing Office you will be greeted by the Computerized Council of Five and given the choice of enrolling or testing.  After choosing to enroll, the computer will ask you to give your name and race (see description of races on page xx).  After this information has been given, the computer will make an analysis of your present abilities and formulate them on a chart such as this:

*(enrollment screen with labels*)

**BODY COMPOSITION** - The more organic you chose to be, the easier you are to kill (damage points).  The less organic you are, the more energy you require to function.  Note: Physicians can heal only organic wounds.  Damage to mechanical body parts must be tended by the Infirmary or by an Electro-Medic.  The Tactical Force requires that a cadet's composition fall between certain boundaries (see chart on page xx) to reach professional status.  BODY COMPOSITION WILL NOT CHANGE ONCE ENROLLMENT IS COMPLETE.

**POWER** - Usage increases during battle and ceases when in the Mothership.

**LOWER REFLEX** - Determines the speed at which you can do things with the legs, like running.  Note:  The speed of certain tasks will reflect BOTH upper and lower reflexes.

**CREDITS** - You will need credits to buy energy, weapons, and other equipment, including robots.  In addition to the credits you brought with you from your home planet, beginning credits can be increased by applying adaptation points to the "credits" column.  The amount of credits increased per adaptation point applied is dependent upon your I.Q..  Never give 10,000,000 or more credits to one character.  The number will "wrap around" to 0, and your credits will not be recoverable.

**UPPER REFLEX** - Determines the speed at which you can do things with the upper body, including aiming and firing weapons, and exchanging equipment.

**STRENGTH** - Determines such things as force of blows (for warriors) and amount of equipment you can carry.

**INTELLIGENCE** - Determines such things as an android's ability to use scanners or to identify foes, or a cybernate's ability to control robots.  It is also a factor which helps to determine beginning credits.

**ADAPTATION POINTS** - These represent ability to adapt.  Can be used to improve your I.Q., STRENGTH, LOWER, and UPPER REFLEX SPEEDS, and financial situation (CREDITS).  All these points must be used before professional status can be achieved.  The Tactical Force will not tolerate cadets who do not give 100% effort.

**POSSIBLE PROFESSION** - When your desired professional choice appears (see chart xx), you are qualified for it.

Your primary goal at this point is to achieve professional status as recognized by the Tactical Force (see profession descriptions on page xx).  To do this you must distribute your adaptation points (learning efforts) to meet the minimum requirements of a profession:

When the desired professional status is obtained and you have selected it, the Computerized Council of Five will ask you to recite...

             THE TACTICAL FORCE LOYALTY OATH:
                   UPHOLD AND SUPPORT

Congratulations !  You are now a Alliance Tactical Force cadet.  All cadets are initially given the rank of 1 by the Computerized Council.  Rank Advancement will be granted upon successful completion of the Tactical Force "Rank Advancement Test," which can be taken in this office at any time.  The results are based upon your knowledge and experience.

After successful completion of the test, a reevaluation of your abilities will be made to determine if physical or mental statistics have improved.  Markers after those statistics will indicate their improvement. Two is the maximum any cadet's stat has ever improved on the advancement of a single rank.

If your test is unsuccessful, you will be told how much more combat experience is needed for you to advance.

## GROUP ASSEMBLY

Your next stop while in the Enrollment Complex is the Group Assembly Office (see Enrollment Complex map).  There you will be assisted by Trepur E. Lelvk, head of Tactical Force training, in forming TRACC Station exploration groups.  In his office you may see a complete listing of cadets, and from there you may add cadets to your group, remove cadets from you group, examine a cadet's statistics, or change a name.

Before adding members to your exploration group, you should know that extensive experiments have been conducted to determine the optimum size for a combat group functioning under TRACC Station conditions.  The results of these tests show that a group of more than 7 individuals is cluttered and inefficient compared to groups of 7 or fewer.  In view of this, Mr. Lelvk will allow a maximum of 7 people to a group.

Choose your group members carefully.  Though your group can be changed at any time with no penalty, an error in recruiting is difficult to correct later on when the group is more experienced and its members are of higher ranks.  Mr. Lelvk suggests that your group consists of the professions listed below.  Of course, you are free to make your groups of any combination of races or professions.  For example if you feel that a successful assault on the TRACC Station can be made by a group of three robots and three human cybernates, give it a try.  Good luck!

#### A BALANCED GROUP
```
  PROFESSION    PURPOSE IN GROUP
  ----------    ----------------
  2 WARRIORS    Front line physical and electrical attack, and defense.
  1 ROBOT       Expendable front line physical and electrical attack, and defense.
  1 CYBERNATE   Control of robot, and knowledge of TRACC Station.
  1 JUICER      Storing of energy, and energy attack.
  1 ANDROID     Translation of information, and identification of enemies.
  1 PHYSICIAN   Healing wounded.
```
While at Group Assembly, you can also examine any cadet's health and statistics to help determine his or her fitness for duty.  For security reasons cadets are allowed to change their names.

#### TO LEAVE THE GAME

Cadets can temporarily resign their commission (leave the game) any time they are in the group assembly office.  Simply type "R" when the option is indicated on the bottom of the screen.

### SHUTTLE SERVICE

After forming your exploration group, you might wish to visit the Home World Shuttle Service (see diagram x) to familiarize your party with its procedures.  If any of you decide to PERMANENTLY resign your commissions and return to your home worlds, this is the place to go.  It is a permanent decision, and you will not be allowed to return to the service of the Alliance if you exercise this option.  We hope you will think twice about retiring from the Alliance.

### INTRASHIP TRANSPORT

If all of your business in the Enrollment Complex is completed, the Intraship Transport system (see Enrollment Complex map on page xx) will teleport you to other complexes.

Unenrolled cadets are not allowed to leave the Enrollment Complex for security reasons.  Single cadets are not allowed to go to the Arsenal or Tesserport, because they simply would not survive in the TRACC Station.  The Arsenal Complex is where you should go next.

## THE ARSENAL COMPLEX

>*(map of arsenal complex)*

Here is where you can purchase what you will need in your expeditions to the TRACC Station.  The Arsenal Complex consists of three offices; the Energy Distribution Center, The Arsenal, and Robot Purchasing and Programing.  It also has TWO intraship transports to encourage one-directional traffic flow.

>*(wanted poster about info seller)*

Note: This wanted poster should appear as a public service advertisement condemning the illegal sale of information.

## ENERGY DISTRIBUTION CENTER

Your first stop in the Arsenal Complex should be the Energy Distribution Center (see Arsenal Complex map).  There, Alliance members may buy or sell raw energy.

In civilian life all five races consume various types of nourishment.  It is more practical, however, for all cadets, while serving in the Tactical Force, use raw energy as the universal food.  By the use of surgically implanted electronic converters, this raw energy is altered to fit the bodily needs of the different races, effectively eliminating the need to consume food physically.  This same raw energy is used to power any mechanical (inorganic) parts of the body.  The Tactical Force has even implanted a Taste Simulator in each cadet's mouth to compensate for any psychological need to eat.

The Energy Distribution Center will provide you with that energy, at cost, during your stay in the Mothership.  Cadets refer to the process of replenishing energy as "juicing up."  The energy cubicles are a safe effective method of transferring energy, and a Tactical Force Energy Distribution Technician will be on hand to monitor your bodily functions during the exchange and to correct any problem that might occur.  Once you are inside the energy cubicle it will appear like this:

>*(energy purchase screen)*

The arrow keys control the quantity to be bought or sold.  The "A" and "Z" keys add or subtract that quantity from your energy level, and the "space bar" completes the transaction.  The price of energy is currently 10 energy units for 1 credit.  Please note that energy can be resold at the same price as purchased.

Now that your group is all juiced up, you're going to want to buy some equipment.  To get this you'll have to go to...

## ARSENAL

Once there (see Arsenal Complex map) you will meet the infamous Preet-Glavis-Wurnn, also known as the Yapper.  You'll find out soon enough that he is not a very likable person.  Some say he is a double-talking money-grabber who will stop at nothing to make a credit, but he does have the best equipment available.  The "RETURN" key will stop and start the Yapper's babbling, and the "SPACE BAR" will begin the transaction.  From him you may purchase the weapons, protective devices, and other miscellaneous equipment which you will need in your quest to alter the Core Computer.  You may also sell, identify, and repair your equipment here.

### BUY EQUIPMENT

Although the arsenal may seem crowded and confusing at first visit, it is not that difficult to find your way around after a little time is spent here.  The following chart will help you understand how the Arsenal is organized.  Make sure you are buying what you want and need because the Arsenal does not buy back used equipment at retail prices. (Energy can be bought and sold at constant prices, but equipment loses value once it is used.)

>*(chart of equipment breakdown)*

When considering equipment you should look carefully at certain things before purchasing.  Some of these considerations are shown an this example screen, but detailed descriptions and technical information on equipment can be found in the Combat Strategy, and Equipment Manual, Physicians Reference Manual, or in Masson's Guide to Xenology.

Preet-Glavis-Wurnn suggests that beginning cadets purchase this equipment:

    WARRIOR                     PHYSICIAN
    ----------------            ---------
    BLUE BEAM DAGGER            DIAGNOSER
    FLY PISTOL                  CELL REGENERATOR
    CLEAR E ARMOR               5% FORCE SHIELD

    BENDER C HELMET             BENDER C HELMET
    (ROBOT)

    JUICER
    ---------------
    BENDER C HELMET

It is important that the cybernate has enough credits left to buy a robot at:

## ROBOT PURCHASING AND PROGRAMING

Only cybernates can buy, sell, or trade in robots or robot parts, and they must be present during the transaction.  They also must have a minimum of xxx credits to make a robot purchase.  There has never been a cybernate capable of handling two robots at a time.  Therefore, robot purchase information is registered in the memory banks of the council computer and cybernates will not be able to own more than one robot at a time.  Robots, which are made to order, consist of several parts, each of which determines the robot's capabilities.  For robot technical information see the Cybernetics Technical Journal beginning on page xx.

After all choices have been made and the robot has been paid for, you may pick it up at the Group Assembly Office in the Enrollment Complex.  There you can change its name if you wish.  Be sure you charge it up at the Energy Distribution Center.  But before leaving for your first expedition, make a stop at the...

## INFIRMARY

>*(map of infirmary)*

This is the place where all ailing cadets can go to receive healing.  Infirmary physicians and technicians are some of the best in the Alliance, and our facilities can handle any problem you might encounter.

>*(mail order ad, in between pages)*

Note: This is strictly a atmosphere thing.

Once there (see Infirmary map) you can receive a variety of treatments and services.  A competent Physician can heal most ailments with the proper equipment.

*The following section may be transferred to the Physicians Reference Manual portion of the manual.*

**REJUVENATE** - Rejuvenation is for normal, organic cell regeneration.  This includes burns, cuts, scrapes, blaster damage, laser damage, and electrical energy damage, including partial disintegrations.  Treatment here does not include damage to inorganic body parts.  Rejuvenation is the same as the healing action done by a Cell Regenerator (see the Physicians Reference Manual on page xx).

**REPAIR** - Inorganic parts of the body can be repaired in the Infirmary by Electro-Medic and Cybernetic repair experts.  Robots can also be repaired with this option.  Repair in the Infirmary is comparable to the use of a Circuit Repairer by a Electro-Medic.

**ILLNESS** - poison, coma, etc.

**BLINDNESS**

**DECOMPRESS** - Decompression is for cadets that have been atomically compressed.  The decompress option will also bring cadets back to life if they are dead.  Decompression is available only in the Mothership Infirmary.

**CLONES** - This option is to prevent the loss of experienced Tactical Force cadets by the use of a back-up cloning system.  It is to your advantage to purchase a clone (identical biological reproduction) of every member of your group as soon as possible to ensure the preservation of their skills and knowledge.  Please make note that a clone can be made of any race, BUT A CLONE CANNOT BE MADE FROM A CLONE.  Cloning is available only in the Mothership Infirmary.

**POWER FAIL** - This option is for group members who are lost in the TRACC Station.  If a power failure should occur during the game, thus "trapping" the characters of a group in the TRACC Station, they can be retrieved by selecting the "power fail" option at the Infirmary.  The cadets will then be returned to the condition they were in before the group entered the station.  This is available only in the Mothership Infirmary.

>*(infirmary screen)*

Once all medical arrangements are in order, it's time for a mission to the TRACC Station.  Displacement (or Tesseraction) to the TRACC Station is done at the...

## TESSERPORT

The Tesserport is still considered an experimental transportation device, but its use in these times of need is considered justified.  The Tesserport is the only teleportation device which does not require a receiving mechanism at the desired destination.  The process uses the particle breakdown and re-assembly process used in normal teleporters; however, the scrambled particles are beamed through space and reassembled from the teleport origin, which allows the Tactical Force to tesserport objects to locations which haven't been obtained it cannot be obtained by ordinary methods.  Of course, it also works in reverse; can lock onto something and tesserport it back.  Before the invention of the tesserport, conventional methods were used to explore places; then, if return trips were desired, a teleport terminal was installed there.  But in a situation such as the TRACC Station where teleport terminals were destroyed by Naja and where it is too hostile to construct a teleporter, the tesserporter is ideal.  A tremendous amount of energy is consumed in the Tesseraction process, but the Tactical Force does not require you to provide it or pay for it.

>*(map of tesserport)*

Before tesseracting, it is important to double-check all aspects of your group (see check-list below) and to make sure that you are prepared for battle.  Then step onto the tesseraction platform (xx above) to make the reactor ready for tesseraction.  Almost all tesserporters experience a dizziness during and shortly after tesseraction; this is normal.

To get back to the mothership safely, you must be aware of what the Alliance calls the "Tesser-Zone," but first you must learn how the TRACC Station is organized.

# Technical Reference Manuals

This is the beginning of the technical (profession specific) reference manuals.  They will contain quite a bit of mood information (e.g components of a laser sword, origin of an enemy alien race).  Of course the player may get helpful hints out of these sections.  They will also contain more specific information which is needed by the player, but would probably confuse them if put up in the General Information Manual.

## WEAPONS

### BEAM-TYPE

Beam-type weapons include laser beam swords, daggers, and whips.  They can be used only on foes in close proximity.  The cutting power of the beam depends upon the wavelength (distinguishable by color) of the laser light emitted from the weapon.  Red (strong), Green (medium), Blue (weak) are the three colors and strengths that you can purchase.  At one time there was a limited stock of powerful white beam swords (called lasbeam swords) available to cadets, but they have all been lost in the Station.  The Green beam swords and daggers cannot be used by robots because of electrical interference.

**LASER DAGGERS** - Laser beam is approximately .5 meter long.

**LASER SWORD** - Laser beam is approximately 1 meter long.

>*(illustration of beam weapons)*

Note: This description of laser whips might be turned into a council log entry.  Someone in the group will invent the thing and describe it.

**LASER WHIPs** are actually an invention gone wrong.  Tactical Force weapon developers were attempting to make a laser sword with rifled light action similar to that of the current blasters, hoping to make it more powerful.  What they got when the laser light was rifled and reflected by the suspensor magnet tip was a peculiar writhing, bending action not seen in any other laser weapon.  The present laser whip has been modified to include an auto-retractable beam to help prevent injury to yourself and to other cadets; however, it is still a very dangerous weapon and should be used only by the best warriors.  The beam length is approximately 4 meters.

### BLASTER-TYPE

Blaster-type weapons release a burst of amplified ion energy, of variable intensity and of virtually unlimited range.  The intensity of this blast of energy depends upon the amount of energy sent through the ion converter mechanism and upon the quality of the ion reflection mirrors used in the blaster.  A blaster's damage, though it appears to be physical, is actually electrical.

**PISTOL** - A one-handed blaster.  They come in a variety of strengths and energy usages.

**RIFLE** - A two-handed blaster.  They are more accurate and powerful than Pistols because of the patented ionic rifle mechanism, which makes the ion burst virtually twist around itself; thus its electron exchange (and its electrical charge) gets increased by its own action.

>*(detailed illustration of blaster)*

### THROWN

**GYRO BOOMERANG** is a misleading name; a Gyro Boomerangs is a  thrown object which returns to the thrower, but that is where the similarity to the original Earth boomerang ends.  It does not fly in the same way, not even on the same principles.  Gyro Boomerangs receive flight trajectory directions directly from the brain and are 100% accurate.  Three small thrusters give the boomerang tremendous speed, and a gyro gives it stability.  It does not rotate, and will return upon your mental command, hit or miss.  A Gyro Boomerang will not miss what it is "aimed" at, but can be dodged.  They're inherent abilities allow them to avoid obstacles on the way to the target.

**SONIC GRENADEs** work on the same principle that blasters do, except it is sound amplification instead of light which does the damage.  Sonic amplification is not easy to control nor direct, which is why the Sonic Grenade is the only device to come from this technology.  It is basically a hand-thrown, impact responding weapon which emits sonic "shrapnel".

**ISOLATORs** are hand-held energy "nets" which are used to restrict the movement of opponents.  Similar to the stasis force shields worn by the Tactical Force cadets, the isolator works in reverse, preventing things from getting out, but allowing things to be passed in from outside the "net" such as a blaster shot, or laser sword beam.

*(alien caught in isolator)*

Isolators are activated when they strike an object after being armed and thrown.  When it is activated, a slightly visible stasis field entraps the object and restricts its movements for a short period of time.  The duration of the isolator depends upon the resistance put up by the entrapped foe.  Therefore, the optimum application of the isolator's attributes would be on a quick but weak enemy, where its primary defense (agility, dodging, etc.) would be countered by the movement restricting isolator.  The isolated alien could then be eliminated at the earliest convenience by a group member.

*Note: This description of isolator may not stay.  The isolators may not be available to beginning cadets.*

## PROTECTION

### ARMOR

Armor is the main source of protection for warriors.  It is basically a stasis force shield implanted in a high-impact plasteel armor casing.  The stasis field offers electrical damage protection (see force shields), while the plasteel gives protection from physical damage.  Armor will hamper the wearer's upper and lower agility unless bought with smart metal capability (mechanical movement assistance, activated by brain impulse signals).  Armor manufacturers can be recognized by the accompanying brand names on the electrical rating portion of the armor.  The second component of armor, the plasteel, has no patent and the physical rating (A-E) relates to thickness.  Of course the thicker the plasteel, the more it will hamper the wearer's movements, unless it has smart metal.

### HELMETS

HELMETs are plasteel protective head pieces similar to armor.  Some helmets can be bought with slots for protective attachments.

### ATTACHMENTS

Attachments are protection devices inserted in helmet slots.  They are not a permanent feature of helmets and can be installed or removed by any cadet.

**DISSIPATOR** - A grounding device which harmlessly disperses part of an electrical attack.

**IMAGE GENERATOR** - An attachment which projects a holographic image of   the wearer in the empty space to his or her right.  This image parallels the wearer's movements, and from a moderate distance is indistinguishable from the wearer.  This has two beneficial results: it makes the group seem larger and might frighten enemies off, and it may cause the enemies to attack the image instead of the real cadet.

**BLAST VISOR** - A plate which covers the eyes of the wearer and protects them from damage from all forms of harmful light.  Blast visors are transparent under normal conditions but instantly change when a harmful situation occurs.

### FORCE SHIELDs

Force shields are electrical damage-repellent stasis force-field armor.  When it is activated, an electrical force field barrier envelops the wearer and neutralizes electrical-based attack, like that of a blaster.  Comes in belt form and does not hinder movements.  Not recommended for "front row" personnel because it offers no physical protection.

### GROUNDERS

Grounders are boots which allow a portion of an electrical attack to pass through the body harmlessly into the floor of the TRACC Station tunnels.

Note: this technical manual should be really technical looking and sounding with lots of robot info (non essential) that is incomprehensible to non-cybernate people.

# CYBERNETIC TECHNICAL MANUAL

### HEADS

Standard sensory equipment on robot heads include sound, movement, and heat detection, microwave radar tracking, and balance indicator.  These sensors have only one degree of sensitivity and are permanent elements of all robot heads.  Because of this, cybernates tend to concentrate on the variable elements.  The factors you SHOULD be concerned with when purchasing a robot head are eyesight range, electrical and physical shielding percentages, and the number of attachment slots.

**ATTACHMENT SLOT (YES OR NO)** - The absence or presence of a slot for helmet attachments (i.e., image generator).

**EYESIGHT RANGE (2-7 METERS)** - Distance that the robot can see in the halls and in battle.

**ELECTRICAL SHIELDING (4-16 % DEFLECTION)** - Its susceptibility to electrical damage.

**PHYSICAL SHIELDING (5-15 % DEFLECTION)** - Its susceptibility to physical damage.

### BODIES

The body of the robot determines the upper reflex, strength, and electrical and physical shielding statistics of the robot.  Standard features include a plasteel combat chassis, two full-movement arms, and a Cyclone brand gyroscope stabilizer.

**UPPER REFLEX/STRENGTH (25/25 - 95/95)** - The same as upper reflex and strength for living group members.  See page xx.

**PHYSICAL SHIELDING (10-80 % DEFLECTION)** - Its susceptibility to physical damage.

**ELECTRICAL SHIELDING (10-60 % DEFLECTION)** - Its susceptibility to electrical damage.

### ROBO-WEAPONS

Weapons are attached by the cybernate to the ends of the robot's arms.  The current list of available robo-weapons is quite short, but other weapons are presently being designed and built with robo-attachment capabilities.  There is talk of a robo-hand capable of controlling any normal, unadapted weapon, which once existed before the demise of the original council, but no record of it has ever been found.  It might be worth noting that green beam swords and daggers interfere with robot electrical systems, and robots attempting to use them will suffer memory erasure.  The Five Planets Cybernetic Guild recommends the purchase of one beam-type, and one blaster-type weapon to ensure versatility during battle.

    ROBO-WEAPON       EQUIVALENT
    -----------       ----------
    ROBO-DAGGER       BLUE BEAM DAGGER
    ROBO-SWORD        BLUE BEAM SWORD
    ROBO-BLASTER C    FLY PISTOL
    ROBO-BLASTER B    LIGHT PISTOL
    ROBO-BLASTER A    MEDIUM PISTOL
    NOTHING           BARE HAND

Note: Remember that a robot need not have a weapon in both arms if the cybernate so desires.  Simply select "NOTHING" for the left and/or right arm.

### ENERGY PACKS

Energy packs are needed to power the robot you are constructing.  Once purchased, a pack can be recharged at the Energy Distribution Center.  The Five Planets Cybernetic Guild recommends that the capacity of this pack parallel the capacity of the other members of the group.  The range of the packs is from 3000 to 400,000 units.

### MOVEMENT

Movement ("legs") choice will decide the lower reflex of the robot.  Many forms of robot legs have been tried, and most of the better designs are available to you now.

### PROGRAM CARDS

The last choice for the robot must be the program card.  It is chosen last because the maximum level of the fight program must not exceed the limitations of the robot.  For instance, if a robot with an upper reflex/strength of 25/25 and a lower reflex of 20 were to enter into battle with a program which "thought" it could move at 95 speed with 95 strength, the consequences would be disastrous!  So, if you are not given all of the available program cards to choose from, do not be alarmed; it is for your own safety.  Programs can be bought with an AUTO-START option which will allow the robot to start fighting at the beginning of battle, without waiting for instructions from the cybernate.  The skills of the robot at any program level (1 - 75) are directly parallel to the skills of a warrior at that rank  (e.g., robot with a 44a program = 44th rank warrior).  Note: all robot fight programs can also be switched, by a cybernate, to "carry" mode.  robots can then carry either 3 or 5 additional articles of equipment. Robots, when in this mode, cannot fight in battle.  This option is handy on profitable expeditions.

### SELL/TRADE

Selling a complete robot is easy.  Simply select the "sell a complete robot" option, and an approximate value price will be offered.  It is then up to you to decide if you wish to sell.

The other sell option (trade in parts) allows you to sell one robot part, then purchase a different (usually better) robot part to replace it.  Individual ROBOT PARTS CANNOT BE BOUGHT WITH OUT A TRADE-IN to preserve the supply-demand balance of the Robot Purchasing and Programing Department.

# MASSON'S GUIDE TO XENOLOGY
## TRANSLATION AND IDENTIFICATION

Note:  This portion of the manual is the heart of the game's theft protection.  It is also an integral part part of the game.  The player, in various parts of the game, will need to translate alien languages.  The player, looking at the alien language, compares it to the language break-down tables provided, and feeds in the proper code into the android's translator.

The term "tables" is deceiving; these tables are not an example of every language simply put into a table, but rather the component-type elements of all languages ripped apart and illustrated.  The player must determine the specific language by figuring out each component and feeding them in to the translator.
