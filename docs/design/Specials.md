```

```
if yes:

```
THAT IS WELL.
THE TRAITOR THAT KILLED MY BROTHER IS ALSO AN AGENT OF NAJA.
YOU CAN FIND HIM IN THE CENTRAL ROOM OF FACE X OF THIS SHELL.
THE KNOWN ENTRANCE TO HIS ROOM IS LOCKED AND YOU COULD NOT GET THROUGH IT AND SURVIVE BATTLE WITH HIM.  HE IS A VERY DANGEROUS ADVERSARY.
THERE'S ANOTHER WAY: A HIDDEN DOOR, ACROSS THE ROOM FROM THE OTHER, INSTALLED FOR ESCAPE PURPOSES.
I LEFT A TINY MARKER ON THE WALL PANEL WHICH HAS THE HIDDEN DOOR.
IF YOU WERE TO BURST IN SUDDENLY AND GUN HIM DOWN BEFORE HE CAN REACT YOU MIGHT LIVE.
SOURCES INFORM ME THAT HIS DESK FACES THE MAIN ENTRANCE, SO HE SHOULD HAVE HIS BACK TO YOU.  BE QUICK.  BE MERCILESS.
```

if no:

```
THE ALIEN BURSTS OFF RUNNING DOWN THE HALL WITH INCREDIBLE SPEED.  NO ONE COULD CATCH HIM NOW.
```

```
(CYBERNATE) SAYS IT'S A STORAGE CABINET ORIGINALLY MEANT FOR ROBOT REPAIR EQUIPMENT.
SOMEONE HAS FILLED IT WITH WEAPONS.
IT COULD BE A TRAP.

WHICH (ARROW KEYS) DO YOU CHOOSE (SPACE BAR) TO EXAMINE?

> HEAVY PISTOL
  HEAVY RIFLE
  LIGHT PISTOL
  GREEN BEAM SWORD
  ETC.
  NONE
```

if none is chosen then door closes and original text comes up.
if any of the others are chosen then:

```
WHO WISHES TO EXAMINE THE (CHOICE)?

> BLASTER    WAR  ...
  ETC.
```

`(CHOICE)`  (pause right here for a second to create suspense)  `ISN'T BOOBY TRAPPED.`

then back to "which (arrow keys) do..."

none of the equipment is trapped.
